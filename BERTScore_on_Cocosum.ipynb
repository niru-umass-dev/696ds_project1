If you go to montreal and dont stay here you're missing out!\"], 'entity_b_reviews': [\"My stay at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth didn't exceed my expectations, and also didn't disappoint. It was a nice hotel, but didn't blow me away. My room was slightly smaller than average although it was clean and with a slightly more modern decor than a typical Fairmont. My one gripe is with the toilet. It's basically the kind of toilet you'd find in a public bathroom, with a flush that's located under the counter and hard to get to. I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus. Overall I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area or closer to Old Montreal. It was fine for business travel and a short trip, but if I was visiting for vacation with the same budget, I'd likely go elsewhere.\", \"I stayed here whilst attending a conference in the hotel. Arriving from Toronto by train was just about as convenient as it could possibly be since the station is directly beneath the hotel. The room was fine, with a fabulous view up the hill to Mont Royal from the top floor. Service from the check-in staff was polite and efficient and they rapidly corrected some incorrect charges for using the mini bar which I had not done. The hotel does look a little dated and not much of the glamour from when John and Yoko staged their bed in remains, but all in all it's a good value and well-located place to stay in Montreal. Make sure you join the President's club via the fairmont website before arriving so that you get free wi-fi access.\", 'This is a very nice older, upper end, well maintained hotel. The front desk and concierge staff were very helpful and the housekeeping staff exceptionally friendly and accomodating. John Lennon and Yoko Ono had a suite on the 16th floor that has a plaque that says \"Give Peace A Chance\". The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was too small. I personally hate any bathroom where my knees block the door from closing when seated. I continually worried that my toiletries would slide off the small shelf for toiletries into the toilet or jewlery would head south for the sink. I had some allergies which I suspect may have been an a/c ducting issue. Beyond these comments it is a nice hotel with very pleasant and helpful staff.', 'We spent a night at the Queen E with our grandchildren - it is a very nice place to stay - somewhat expensive but right in the center of Montreal.

On our last morning, we were told to leave our baggage at the lobby while breakfast and we did. When we returned, we sadly found out that one of our baggage, the one containing most of our gifts, was missing. Since we wouldn't be able to go back and get new ones, it was really devastating for us. The staff members were not even slighly interested in the situation. We asked for police assistance but they didn't even bother to call; saying the police could do nothing about it. Nobody asked about what happened or anything; as if nothing had happened. The apathy, the staff members showed, made us regretfully think that some of them may have something to do with the robbery.\", 'We stayed at Holiday Inn Express Rome San Giovanni simply going by what others had to say about the place in Tripadvisor.

It sits on a quiet little canal just behind the magnificent Chiesa di Santa Maria and not far from the Accademia. The staff was very friendly, treated its guests with real coridality and were brimming with suggestions and assistance. Breakfast was especially satisfying in a tall room that spangled with Venetian ornament. The hotel felt very personal, it was like staying at the home of a friend. Who should stay here? Couples, old or young, families, no matter the size, single folk, businessmen. I look forward to going back to Venice and when I do so staying at the Ca Maria Adele. Recommended without any reservation whatever.', 'Just stop searching for the perfect hotel in Venice because this is the one. Right next to the Salute is an idyllic spot with just twelve rooms. The staff are without exception helpful and no request is too small. The breakfast is a delight and can be served wherever suits your mood and the hotel has wonderful touches throughout. Each room is individualised and ours overlooked the canal. A minute from the vaparetto stop and close to a number of super Art Galleries . Lovely little restaurant was recommended and did not disappoint. Take the Water Taxi transfer - the only way to travel.Just ignore the tariff it is worth every penny. Enjoy.', 'Loved this small hotel, with a great location on the Grand Canal and right next door to the Salute Church. The staff were polite and very helpful, no problems with the English language. Will never forget the Saturday night when the Salute bells were ringing followed by all the church bells around Venice. Close to San Marco Square. If you stay on the top floor be ready for a walk up the stairs to your room.', 'Paying attention to every detail, this hotel was an experience of its own. The White Room on the bottom floor was spectacular, the room service was top notch, the views from all points of the hotel were nearly fantastical! Breakfast was delicious (though one staff member seemed absolutely miserable with her job) and the always stocked minibar was so refershing during the hot summer days!', 'We loved the Ca Maria Adele. The hotel staff and owner were so attentive. The room was incredible and so so charming. We were greeted by champagne and passion fruit within 5 minutes of walking into our hotel. The breakfast room and the meal itself were just great. All the recommendations given by the hotel staff were awesome. Would LOVE LOVE to go back.', 'This is one of the best deals in Venice.

We went for the highest room (Casa Nova) in the hotel which has a sky window that opens up to see the sky at night, it was very romantic. Breakfast was truly a gem - the croissants are made fresh and they tasted super delicious. There are only two tables that are out on the balcony so people have to wait for the outdoor tables. They offer free water taxi rides to the glass factory on Murano island, but it was a complete waste of time. Transport organized by the hotel to the island was perfect, but the hotel didn't arrange our transportation back and we were stuff with like 10 other people in small boat which made us completely soaked on our way back. The boat did not stop back at our hotel but just dropped us off, all soaked, at St. Mark's Square. It was the worst boat ride. Avoid the hotel's free ticket to Murano at all, you can better spend your time in Venice doing something else.\", \"We had originally booked our rooms at the Hotel Antiche Figure, however when we arrived at the hotel the manager told us that he had another hotel that they were attempting to fill with guests right down the street, it was another property that they owned that had recently opened up. .He told us that if we wanted to stay there instead of the Antiche Figure he would upgrade everyone's rooms. When we saw the property and the rooms, we just couldn't say no. The manager put us in four incredible rooms beautifully decorated in an antique Venetian style, yet with very modern facilities. ie Wireless. flat screen tv's hidden behind mirrors etc, plus the rooms had amazing views onto the canal, or the square. which was wonderfully quiet. This place is beautiful. I would highly reccomend staying here. especially if you are American. the service of the staff is completely up to par with American standards. and on that matter they excel on sevice standards.\", 'I love it when Tripadvisor reviews point me in the right direction.

Make sure to print out directions to the hotel for your arrival. The rooms were elegant and comfortable. Nice breakfast in the morning. The staff were pleasant and very helpful.
