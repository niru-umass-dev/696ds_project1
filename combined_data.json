      "This all suite hotel is flawless. Around the holidays season, the hotel was well decorated for X-mas with lovely Palm trees and Christmas lights. This hotel is so close to the beach and is perfectly located for peace and quiet. The airport and Duval street is only a short shuttle away, but downtown is quite far away. Morden rooms with great size and a lot of storage space. The beds are super comfortable. The bathroom is also pretty large with a nice vanity area. The staff were even willing to help with last minute late checkout request. The restaurant provides great food, but it closes too early for us. The hotel actually has bikes to rent. Parking close-by can be very pricey per day. The elevators feel not safe.",
      "Overall, as an all-suite hotel, the place was great. It's not the fanciest, but it was beautifully decorated for Christmas with lights on the palm trees and it was very enjoyable. The hotel is just across the street from Smather's Beach and is only a short walk, shuttle ride or bike trip away from Duval street. The rooms are large and spacious with lots of storage space and are clean with comfortable beds and also have a big bathroom. The vanity is very nice and the room is spacious enough to kick back in but also close to one of the few beaches in Key West. In the restaurant, the staff was very good. If at all possible the staff tried to accommodate late checkouts for all who requested it. Fantastic service. Although the restaurant closed at 9 and the bar also closed too early for the crowd, at 11. The food and staff was great. The hotel's elevators are not recommended to be used. Parking in the Duval Street area is pricey but the hotel has plenty of bicycles that are available to rent too.",
      "The hotel is well maintained, functional and the decor is good. The hotel has a public beach, Smathers Beach, across the road. Duval Street and downtown is only an hour away and you can take the shuttle there too. every hour. The hotel is also close to the airport, If you own a bicycle it is a great location too. They were comfortable beds in a spacious room . Lots of storage available and a modern and clean environment. A large bathroom in the room too. The hotel provided excellent food but the restaurant closes at 9pm which may be a little early for some tourists. The only complaint would be that the elevators are scary. Parking on Duval Street ranges between $10 and $35 per day but the hotel has bikes to rent so parking costs can be lessened or avoided."

Although the airport and Duval Street are just a short shuttle away, downtown is further away. The rooms are modern in design and have plenty of space for storage. The beds are incredibly comfortable and the bathroom also has ample room and a nice vanity area. The staff were kind enough to accommodate a late checkout request.

It was not the most luxurious, yet it had festive d\u00e9cor, such as lights on the palm trees, which made it all the more festive. It was in a great location, being across the street from Smather's Beach, and was even closer to Duval Street with the easy access of walking, taking a shuttle, or biking. All the rooms were large, and were nicely stored and cleaned with comfortable beds, and big bathrooms with nice vanities. The food and staff at the restaurant was also very good, and late check outs were possible if requested. The only downside was the bar and restaurant closed too early; at 11 pm. Parking could be expensive and the elevators are not to be recommended, but the hotel has plenty of bicycles for renting.",

The beds are comfortable and the room is roomy. There is lots of storage space and it is a modern, spotless atmosphere. The room also has a huge bathroom. The food from the hotel is terrific, but the restaurant closes at 9 which may be too early for tourists. The only problem is the elevators which are somewhat intimidating. The daily parking rate on Duval Street is between $10 and $35, however the hotel provides bicycles to rent which reduces or eliminates the cost of parking."

Extremely friendly and helpful staff at this hotel, who are very attentive to the needs of their guests and go above and beyond to make them feel welcome.

The room itself, although tiny, had a very large bathroom, as well as a nice view of the canal. Some of the staff seemed friendly, but many were apathetic and aloof. Prices for breakfast were okay, yet the food was not very fresh and did not last long. The pastries were not fresh, and the eggs were not enjoyable. The shower, too, was not stable and let out dousing streams of hot water that could be dangerous.",
      "\n\nThis hotel is in a great spot near Leidsplein, the Herengeracht canal and Dam Square, as well as being conveniently close to Anne Frank's House. Situated on a peaceful canal street, but still not far from Central Amsterdam\u2019s main road, it\u2019s an excellent pick. The rooms may come up a bit small though they are suitable for shorter stays. The bathrooms are roomy and from here one can take in views of the canal. The staff were mostly courteous and professional, except for some who were more laid-back and not as keen to help. Breakfast options were somewhat limited and there were a few lower-quality items available. Prices for the food were fair. On the downside, the shower in the bathroom was overly hot and wasn\u2019t securely attached, but the management rectified this when it was brought to their attention."

Key landmarks and local galleries are within walking distance. This hotel can boast of having heavenly beds and clean rooms but the shower sprayed outside of the shower stall and caused puddles on the floor.

The hotel offered ginger snaps in the lobby and free drinks to guests plus in the room there was free bottled water. Breakfast was also offered free.

The room was well arranged but could have been cleaner. The beds were comfortable but in poor condition. The shower room would leak outside the cubicle unless the shower head was positioned appropriately. In general, the staff of the hotel are very helpful and offer good service. The hotel itself is in its infancy, so some of the service can be improved in future. The hotel provides free drinks for guests including bottled water in the room.

This hotel is located to everything you need in New Orleans and not far from Bourbon Street. The rooms were of an average quality, with rather basic furniture and facilities. The cleanliness of the rooms aren't to a very high standard either. The stay started off well because the valet staff are efficient and despite being really busy they maintained a friendly attitude. The front desk staff were also attentive and lovely, but the management let the staff down because they were clearly disinterested in tending to customers. The breakfast options were really limited to pastries and some coffee. Despite inexpensive rates and free parking this hotel is potentially dangerous; there are bed bug infestations that can leave you with huge itching welts.",

This hotel's location is unbeatable because there are lots of charming places to eat and lots of local classic sights are nearby. The rooms in this hotel are generally windowless, horrible and in bad condition. They were not very clean and the furnishings are in need of replacement. Management at this hotel was less than interested in customer service but the valet staff were prompt and friendly and front desk staff were prompt to help with a smile.

Due to this hotel being an older build, there have been some issues with the air conditioning and the sink taps can be very tight. Not only this, but it is very easy to hear background noise as nothing seems soundproof."

The location of this hotel is absolutely great and central, you can walk to many shops, Gaudi 's Casa Batllo , and la Pedrera. The metro station is also really close. A standard room at this hotel is smaller than expected, with most of the space being taken by the huge but very comfortable bed inside. The bathrooms was outdated and need some updating. The room service was overpriced. Unfortunately the hotel's breakfast definitely not worth the money. The lifts were a bit inconvenient and request long time wait because there are only two of small and infrequent ones. Also, the rooms facing courtyard at the back are quieter than the ones to the front.",
      "This hotel may be the place you want to stay with each visit to Barcelona. It's not cheap but it is lovely. It's also popular with business travellers but the Spanish do like to beep their horns so staying at the front of the hotel could be noisy and disturbing and leave you disappointed. Being within close proximity of the metro line and only a short walk from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, la Pedrera, and even not far from Sagrada Familia, the location of this hotel is great. It is very centralised with many shops nearby as well. Overall, a fantastic location. The hotel rooms are an adequate size with a decent night's sleep to be had from the bed itself. The bathrooms are a little outdated and could do with a deep clean. The staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful. The hotel had a lovely pillow menu but breakfast was not worth the price paid. The front of the hotel can be loud so it is worth requesting a room facing the courtyard at the back and you may want to consider one of the lower floors to avoid having to take one of the two lifts. They are small and irregular in their arrival causing sometimes long wait times.",

The hotel's staff was really very helpful. The hotel's breakfast was a bit basic and expensive for a 4 star hotel . The lifts in the hotel are a bit cramped and can take some time to arrive.

The cleanliness was good but the room size was a bit underwhelming. As for breakfast, it was nothing too special, but the bonus is that it can be enjoyed close to the interior courtyard.

If you politely request you can get a really great room on the eighth floor which is a King room. It's really big and has free breakfasts and appetisers as well as WiFi internet. Reasonable service at this hotel, with many members of staff very attentive to their guests. The security team were not so helpful but overall the staff seemed quite professional.

      "\n\nThe Conrad hotel is an excellent choice for business travelers or those on a leisurely trip. Guests will be given personalized attention as soon as they arrive, a rarity in the modern day. For those staying at the hotel, it's best to book somewhere close to the areas they plan on visiting as the property is a bit away from the main attractions. Several small restaurants near the hotel are favored by local university students, so that may be something to take into account. The hotel rooms are clean and up to date, yet the view from inside is not as inspiring as the picturesque natural vistas of the Bosporus outside. The service provided by the staff is friendly and efficient, with a personal greeting from the manager to welcome visitors to The Conrad. Delicious meals and great views of the Bosporus can be enjoyed in the restaurant. Lastly, the hotel features a small gym, perfect for those wanting to get a quick workout in. Although a bit out of the way, The Conrad remains a great option for business travelers."

The views from the rooms were typically great and a few of them even had balconies. The rooms themselves weren't overly spacious, but they were tidy and comfortable. Staff members were usually nice and accommodating, but there were occasions when service was not up to standard and customers felt ignored. They charged quite a bit for food, but the quality was not bad. Breakfast was included, but it was the same basic continental spread you would find at many other places. Getting an early check-in was possible upon request but checkout took far too long and was a very unpleasant experience."

This location was pleasant and located in a tree-lined avenue that was used by locals. The hotel room had a lovely view of the canal, with the rotunda and Stalingrad station in the background. A decent sized room with a large bathroom, although without a bath. Clean and tidy room with a comfy bed. Some of the staff at the hotel were helpful, but some had an unprofessional attitude. The hotel served simple French cuisine with a view of the canal, but the breakfast's hot items would go quickly. The hotel has secure parking available below the complex. It is worth nothing that one of the lifts may be out of order, so it takes a little longer to get the other lift.",

The hotel is situated in a good location just outside Paris with two cafe bars nearby. The super clean room had incredible views of the canal and the boats there. Not only that but the beds were both large and really cosy. There was every facility you need apart from having a shower instead of a bath, but that's fine for most people. The staff are pretty helpful and at times they were extraordinary. The hotel offered a basic breakfast. There is secure parking underneath the hotel. There are also lifts provided, which can be a bit of a wait but there are also stairs to use.",

The setting is lovely and really suited to its surroundings, making it a simple yet effective choice. Ideal location just on the outskirts of the main city, with multiple cafe bars close by for guests to enjoy if they fancy leaving the hotel. However, it is not in walking distance from the main station which can be off putting for some. The views from the rooms overlook the canals with its boats and looking onwards to the rotunda near the metro station in Stalingrad. There is also a good-sized bathroom with a great shower, though no bath and the room itself was clean and very large. The bed is comfortable and the rooms included all the expected facilities, an internet connection, and coffee or tea. The service was okay, as the staff generally try to be helpful where they can. But it could be better at times. The French food served nearby the hotel was simple but proper, it was a great place to eat. Sadly the hot but standard breakfast options were gone by a certain time in the morning. The hotel has the option of parking beneath the hotel and it is secured and although there were issues with the lift, stairs were available for use."

      "The hotel was a unique experience with traditional and modern features. A stay at the hotel comes highly recommended. The hotel is situated in an excellent location on the Grand Canal, only a couple of stops to San Marco Square and near to the Salute Church. It is close to a number of art galleries and the Vaporetto. The hotel has rooms overlooking the canal that are nice and clean. The hotel has a simple menu which can be served wherever you like. The minibar is always stocked for guests. Despite being a bit overpriced the hotel did live up to that expectation, so it was worth it.",
      "This is a great stylish contemporary hotel that pays attention to every detail and one that cannot be recommended enough. This boutique hotel is perfectly located because it is on the edge of one of the greatest areas and away from tourist hordes, making it quiet. Despite the calm location it isn't too far away from good sight-seeing spots and there is no problem getting around the city. The rooms are well-maintained and clean, but there is quite a walk up to the room if staying on the top floor. . The breakfast is of the highest quality, and there is the option to eat in either the breakfast room or the roof terrace. The stay at the hotel was a little expensive.",
      "This is an exquisite hotel that is highly recommended. The decor has an excellent mix of contemporary and traditional design that will appeal to the majority. They have paid attention to every detail when designing this hotel. Great location for those wanting a good base to go on and sight see, as it is close to many of the tourist attractions. Most sites are walking distance from the hotel, yet the hotel itself is in a more remote location that offers guests peace and quiet if they choose it. The rooms are very well maintained and clean and though not as distinct as the public areas is unique in its own right. Some overlook the canal.Breakfast is little bit lacking but tasted good."

      "This is a beautiful hotel and possibly one of the best out there. The rooms in the hotel are decorated in a typical Venetian style, but with modern design twist, such as mirrors housing televisions. The highest room available in the hotel has a sky window which was very quiet too. The breakfasts at the hotel were made fresh and could be enjoyed on the terrace. This is a hotel of high standards and qualities and everything seems to be really thought through such as where the plug sockets are place and even the light switch.",
      "The hotel setting is beautiful but it's an uncomfortable boat ride to get there. Good location with walking paths in close proximity to the hotel. Free water taxis can be taken also, however they are not highly recommended. The Venetian-style rooms are absolutely beautiful and had a sky-window to allow you to view the sky at nighttime. There are flat-screen televisions hidden behind mirrors which is a unique touch. Some of the staff were unhelpful, The complimentary breakfast can be eaten on the terrace and it is an absolute gem. The croissants are clearly made fresh and so they tasted amazing. The hotel will look after guests late at night if you need collection for a charge. The attention to detail goes all the way down simple fixtures like light fittings etc.",
      "This is an average hotel to stay at, however it is in a beautiful area that has lots for tourists to see. The hotel was a little difficult to get to but they will provide a nicely detailed map for walking paths nearby, because it is located in a lovely place. The rooms are to a very high standard, with exceptional views overlooking some of the popular attractions in this area. The upgraded rooms in particular are wonderful, with a sky window that opens up at night. They are beautifully decorated and provide all amenities for a good stay. The staff occasional go above and beyond to help their guests. The food was delicious. Freshly made croissants and a free bottle of Prosecco, excellent. A bargain hotel that provides good quality service. You can see there has been great efforts put in place to decorate all aspects of this hotel, down to the small details."

Attention has been taken to each and every detail in the design of the establishment. It has a prime location for visitors looking to tour and explore, as it is near many tourist attractions and can easily be accessed on foot from the hotel. Peace and quiet are available to guests as the hotel is more distantly placed. All of the rooms are kept in great condition and though not as special as the public areas, still provide their own individual flair, with many featuring canal views. Breakfast was satisfactory and tasty."

Some of the staff, unfortunately, were not very accommodating. Yet the complimentary breakfast served on the terrace was superb - the freshly-made croissants were delicious.

Excellent location for that is on a quiet street, but also allow easy reach for principal city sights; the metro and city tour bus stop are really close. Clean and large room with a great renovated bathroom. The staff are a wealth of knowledge about the nearby restaurants , side trips, which was was super helpful. The breakfast not only has lots of choice but the quality of the continental foods and drinks on offer was great. They also provide take away breakfast. No wireless internet in the rooms, only available in the lobby.",
      "The Oceania is a 2 - 3 star hotel but where it lacks in its grandeur it makes up for it with its staff. There is also the enjoyable music in the air from the nearby opera school and the hotel is not only comfortable but clean. The hotel's location is excellent. It lies just off of the Piazza della Repubblica on a quiet street and is close to buses and trains to allow reaching the city and sights easily. The hotel had a spotlessly clean, old double room with a great renovated bathroom. Breakfast was an ample continental breakfast with bread, pastries, juices, and coffee. it was lovely and you can get it to take away if you need to leave early. The Internet was only available in the lobby.",

This hotel is beautifully set for walking to great sites of the city as well as shops and outdoor restaurants located close-by. The small complex that the hotel is located within had some beautiful orange trees as well, adding to the colourful neighbourhood. The rooms here are really lovely although were a bit noisy with doors banging. The breakfast buffet was really tasty if a little bit basic. The scrambled eggs are highly recommended. There was some noise coming from the bells of the nearby church therefore it is recommended to bring earplugs.",
      "This hotel provides a wonderful, cosy and convenient place to stay. It is a little pricey however it's really charming. The hotel is ideally situated for local restaurants, being only a stone's throw from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto too. The hotel is close to a tram link to the airport, Tivoli and other areas in Rome. It was great that the rooms opened onto the courtyards but this and the tiled floors made them rather noisy. The hotel's breakfast was adequate but was nice to enjoy in a courtyard of orange trees. It is worth mentioning that the bell chimes from a nearby church can clearly be heard in the rooms, which may be a negative for some guests.",
      "This hotel is a very nice and convenient base to explore Rome and the Vatican from but lacks a personal touch. It is cozy and charming but maybe overrated a little. This hotel is ideal for restaurants and in the middle of Trastevere and is only a block away from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto and within walking distance of the center of Rome, Campo Fiore and Janiculum. It is also not far from the tram with connections to the airport and there are lots of shops and beautiful colorful neighborhoods all around. The rooms are lovely in that there is the option for them to be opened out into the open air with the courtyards. However, the rooms can be become rather noisy due to the tilen floors and the doors that bang. There were not many staff here. Generally a very good buffet breakfast that offers scrambled eggs and cappuccino amongst other things. There is also access to the lovely courtyard that is covered in orange trees for when you want to eat your breakfast. The bells from the nearby church could cause sleep issues."
