      "This all suite hotel is flawless. Around the holidays season, the hotel was well decorated for X-mas with lovely Palm trees and Christmas lights. This hotel is so close to the beach and is perfectly located for peace and quiet. The airport and Duval street is only a short shuttle away, but downtown is quite far away. Morden rooms with great size and a lot of storage space. The beds are super comfortable. The bathroom is also pretty large with a nice vanity area. The staff were even willing to help with last minute late checkout request. The restaurant provides great food, but it closes too early for us. The hotel actually has bikes to rent. Parking close-by can be very pricey per day. The elevators feel not safe.",
      "Overall, as an all-suite hotel, the place was great. It's not the fanciest, but it was beautifully decorated for Christmas with lights on the palm trees and it was very enjoyable. The hotel is just across the street from Smather's Beach and is only a short walk, shuttle ride or bike trip away from Duval street. The rooms are large and spacious with lots of storage space and are clean with comfortable beds and also have a big bathroom. The vanity is very nice and the room is spacious enough to kick back in but also close to one of the few beaches in Key West. In the restaurant, the staff was very good. If at all possible the staff tried to accommodate late checkouts for all who requested it. Fantastic service. Although the restaurant closed at 9 and the bar also closed too early for the crowd, at 11. The food and staff was great. The hotel's elevators are not recommended to be used. Parking in the Duval Street area is pricey but the hotel has plenty of bicycles that are available to rent too.",
      "The hotel is well maintained, functional and the decor is good. The hotel has a public beach, Smathers Beach, across the road. Duval Street and downtown is only an hour away and you can take the shuttle there too. every hour. The hotel is also close to the airport, If you own a bicycle it is a great location too. They were comfortable beds in a spacious room . Lots of storage available and a modern and clean environment. A large bathroom in the room too. The hotel provided excellent food but the restaurant closes at 9pm which may be a little early for some tourists. The only complaint would be that the elevators are scary. Parking on Duval Street ranges between $10 and $35 per day but the hotel has bikes to rent so parking costs can be lessened or avoided."

      "It was overpriced here at this hotel and the cleaning standards were only okay. This hotel isn't in a great location because it was outside of the old town, which is where some good attractions are. Whilst somewhat nice to be away from the main strip it could have been closer to the main attractions. Some of the staff were rude and unhelpful. You can eat your breakfast at the outside restaurant when staying at this hotel, which is really enjoyable. This is a great stay and you can ask for a reduced rate if you are a Florida resident. The pool is really worth checking out, as well at the hot tub.",
      "The accommodation at the hotel was very comfortable and a fun atmosphere to be in on holiday. The hotel did seem expensive though. The rooms in this hotel are mostly clean and the beds were great. The hotel had an al fresco restaurant for serving breakfast, The hotel has a fantastic pool area and hot tub available. It is also worth mentioning that you can ask for a Florida resident's rate as well to save some money.",
      "Although the hotel is comfortable and fun, some may feel the need to stay elsewhere due to the price, lack of cleanliness and cockroaches. The hotel isn't as convenient to get to the old town but you may find it nice to be further away from the main strip. The rooms are generally clean and the beds are good. The staff have a great attitude and try their best to solve any issues that may arise. Florida residents get a residence rate and the hotel has a pool and a hot tub."

This location is great if you're looking to access the great fun and action close-by, but with that comes hustle-and-bustle noise from the street the hotel is located on. The rustic rooms here are a little small but really comfortable and clean while the beds are big. There was a thatched roof to the room that provided an airy feel but of course not soundproof.

Breakfasts were really good above the garden but also the breakfast-to-go option was great too. Unfortunately there was no private parking available here at this hotel.",
      "This hotel is excellent value for money, and offers a pleasant experience to be had with it's stunning garden and courtyard. A very charming atmosphere for guests to relax. The hotel's location is very conveniently located near 5th Avenue and Playa. It is a busy street so noise might be a factor to consider when staying here. The rooms are small and cosy in size, but they make it for it in character. The high vaulted thatched roof, although not soundproof, gives the room a much more airy feel to it and you can listen to the relaxing patter of raindrops. The quality of the rooms are exceptional, with lots of space, and big, comfortable beds for a good night's sleep. Breakfast could be taken on the go or taken above the garden. This hotel is lacking in private parking."

      "The hotel is a highlight of the Yucatan province and is different to the commercial areas such as Cancun. The food at the hotel is highly recommended and in general the hotel's worth repeat visits. The location is absolutely perfect and is really close to shopping and restaurants options. The rooms are basic but the showers work well. The rooms are purposefully lacking in mod cons such as TVs, radios and phones. Uniquely, the towels provided in the room are sculpted into animal shapes. The two big-sized pools were perfect as well as some ping-pong tables. The internet accessibility is a bit of a let-down unfortunately.",
      "This hotel will provide a wonderful experience with a relaxing atmosphere and truly is a unique place to stay. The hotel is only around 45 minutes away from Cancun airport , with a shuttle service provided by the hotel. The rooms do not feature mod-cons like televisions, radios or clocks however the beds are super comfortable and the showers provided work really well. In the nighttime there was always a member of staff around as well, which gives a sense of security. The food provided was really good. The hotel has dome fantastic feature such as access to a beach, two swimming pools and a table tennis table. It is worth nothing that the hotel could improve its internet access and the surrounding hotels can be noisy too.",
      "This resort is beautiful and offers the most amazing experience. It is gorgeous and the gardens and landscaping are brilliant and peaceful and one of the most relaxing places away from the bustle of Cancun. The hotel location is only 45 minutes from the airport and within a couple of blocks fo the main shopping street. It is also within easy walking distance of 5th Avenue for shopping or eating. Some nice touches in the rooms are the sculptured towels - of animals. And the artwork in each room. Also nice, was a lack of items like TVs, radios, clocks or even phones. Very relaxing and there were hammocks as well. Besides that the bed is comfortable and there is also a sheltered porch. The staff at this hotel make it easy for their guests to feel safe and secure, with appropriate attendants on shift at all hours of the day. The food is good. The hotel is nothing like an all-inclusive place which was perfect although the internet access wasn't great and noise from surrounding hotels was too loud at times."

The rooms at this hotel are quite expensive, yet the rooms are considerably small. However, they are decorated to a good standard and equipped with all amenities.

There is a wide variety of restaurants. In this hotel, guests will have either an apartment-style room away from the main hotel or a large room with a big bathroom in the hotel directly. Be aware of small beds and holes in the sheets though. Not all staff can speak English but the majority can, and they do so clearly.

However, there can be an issue with noise in some rooms as they are next to the delivery area and the heating/AC units can be very loud.

      "Overall the hotel is a really unique place to stay. The location is pretty good but doesn't have great access to a subway line. There's mainstream shopping and the theatre quarters close-by though which adds to how good the location is. The shower in the room was very modern. Most of the staff were friendly to guests. This hotel has a small restaurant that provides superb food that very proudly uses local and organic produce. The hotel has an archaic elevator which is a novelty.",
      "This hotel is a unique space for musicians and artists etc to hang out and perform, though some may find that a detriment to their stay. The hotel is ideally situated for socialising in Queen St West, as well as the theatre district and shopping areas. The hotel has great music and food available. The rooms are quite unique but a little disappointing, and the shower is like a horizontal MRI machine. However the beds are great. Aside from the unfriendly reception staff most of the hotel staff were very nice. The hotel has great food; from the small restaurant to the fry bar that promotes local organic produce with lots of variety. This is a great escape even in the city. The very old elevator was also crazily fun.",
      "The Gladstone Hotel Toronto is located in an old building. It is geared towards musicians and artists but allows for foodies and families alike to indulge in performing or showing off their talent too. The location of the hotel isn't the most convenient in regards to the subway, but it is close enough to some amenities and mainstream shopping. Pleasant rooms, with a unique and fun design. The beds are reasonable, and there is the option to upgrade if guests would like to do so. The staff are mostly really nice and cool apart from upon arrival where the staff at that time were frosty. You can get great food from the small restaurant inside the hotel. The Gladstone has a great vintage elevator dating to the turn of the 20th century."

The location of this hotel is perfectly situated for exploring downtown as well as good for a medium-length walk to other attractions and sights. The hotel rooms were spacious and clean. The bathrooms were large and the room had really good bedding. The staff here at this hotel seemed a little bit uninterested but the housekeeping staff did do a really good job cleaning. The hotel had a good choice of food with a lovely breakfast and good curry lunches. The hotel has an ice machine available for guests in the room corridors.",
      "A nice touch is that the spa next to the hotel give a discount if you provide them with proof of a hotel stay. The hotel is close to all of the major downtown sights and travel in the centre of Toronto. It is a short walk to the Eaton Centre and around 25 minutes' walk to the CN Tower. The room at this hotel was pretty big and featured a nice big bathroom with marble-top unit. The breakfast here at the hotel is really good and varied for choice. There was also a bar to drink and dance in, too. There were ice machines in the corridor for guest use, which is great if you like your water cooled down.",
      "Tthe noise levels is surprisingly low for such a busy hotel. Although the restaurant can be expensive, there is a spa on site that also offers discounts to guests staying here. The location of this hotel is perfect for those that want to be close to all amenities, as it based in the city centre of Toronto. It is also walking distance to many of the major attractions in this area which is ideal. Rooms at this hotel are very spacious and cleaned to a high standard. The amenities provided were of an excellent quality and the bedding in particular was very nice. The staff at the hotel were not very interested in their guests. The food at this hotel is of great quality, whether you're eating there during breakfast, lunch or dinner, and it is also affordable dining. There is a great selection on offer for breakfast especially. There is an ice machine in the corridor which is good."

There were great amenities here such as a refrigerator, stove, coffee pot, and others in the small kitchen attached. The staff make sure you have everything and go out of their way to be helpful, treating you like royalty every step of the way. They're really nice. There is an added level of security with this hotel because you need hotel-supplied wristbands to enter the hotel building.",

Rooms are very spacious with all amenities that are needed for a good night's stay. The rooms are slightly outdated but still look reasonably modern and are maintained to a good standard. Extremely friendly and helpful staff at this hotel, who are very attentive to the needs of their guests and go above and beyond to make them feel welcome.

The small room wasn't too well maintained and upon arrival it wasn't even made-up. Despite requesting a quiet room the room that was provided was really noisy. The staff seemed unprofessional and unhelpful. The breakfast provided by the hotel was very good. The parking situation is quite difficult because the pricing is really high per day. Additionally there was no hot water and instead was just tepid.",

Due to the location of the hotel it can be a little noisy at times. The hotel had rooms available that opened onto the courtyard. The rooms were small and noisy. The staff didn't provide much of a service at this hotel and amazingly didn't seem to even know where the closest hospital was. The food provided at breakfast really is great. The garage parking at the hotel is expensive. There was an issue with the water being only lukewarm too. It is worth mentioning that there were a lot of convention attendees making a racket in the hotel in the early morning.",

Bad quality service provided at this hotel, and the staff seem to be unaware of the location of amenities such as the closest hospital.

St. Mark's Square is about an hour's walk away. It is located just 15 minutes away from the airport. The rooms are a little on the small side but do provide a nice view. Owing to very little noise it was fine to keep the window and shutters open. Inside the room it is beautiful.The restaurant Brucinellis in the hotel was okay but the view overlooking the canal was great. The photos are very reflective of how this hotel is in reality.

It was clean but a small though the handicap access was good and comfortable. The bell desk were helpful to arrange transport. The food served in the restaurant is lovely, but if you want a change of pace there are a variety of other options available in close proximity to the hotel.

This hotel is located to everything you need in New Orleans and not far from Bourbon Street. The rooms were of an average quality, with rather basic furniture and facilities. The cleanliness of the rooms aren't to a very high standard either. The stay started off well because the valet staff are efficient and despite being really busy they maintained a friendly attitude. The front desk staff were also attentive and lovely, but the management let the staff down because they were clearly disinterested in tending to customers. The breakfast options were really limited to pastries and some coffee. Despite inexpensive rates and free parking this hotel is potentially dangerous; there are bed bug infestations that can leave you with huge itching welts.",
      "With it being an old, renovated warehouse, this is not your typical hotel and the decor may not suit all tastes. However, as it is still a work in progress the rates are competitive. This hotel's location is unbeatable because there are lots of charming places to eat and lots of local classic sights are nearby. The rooms in this hotel are generally windowless, horrible and in bad condition. They were not very clean and the furnishings are in need of replacement. Management at this hotel was less than interested in customer service but the valet staff were prompt and friendly and front desk staff were prompt to help with a smile. The hotel claims to serve breakfast but only serve pastries and coffee. The beds contained bugs and though the rates were low and the parking free it was not worth it."

It's also based in the centre of the city, so it is an excellent base for people to start from when sight seeing. The view is great because the hotel is set in such a beautiful location. There are transport links nearby however it is only a ten minutes' walk to the city centre. Whilst the room had a really good view in this hotel, the beds were incredibly hard. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and useful to help with directions and tourist information. You can also have a drink in the lobby before going to dine, or there is also a rooftop balcony in the hotel with a view of the Arno below. The hotel provided free internet access via a booth terminal in the lobby.",

Great location near the Arno and within easy walking distance of the city center. The area is clean and quiet and away from the business of the city attractions and so is peaceful. The rooms are beautifully decorated and are an excellent size, especially compared to other hotels in this area. The bathrooms in particular are particularly large. A small, close knit team yet extremely knowledgeable and helpful in accommodating their guests; whether it be directions, taxis or restaurant recommendations to name a few. The staff are always polite and friendly and they work very hard to meet everyone's needs. This hotel is a lovely experience, offering beautiful views from the hotel balcony. Not only this, but this hotel also provides a computer with free internet access for its guests."

It is close to the train station and the main attractions in Florence by foot. There are also nearby buses that go to Fiosole, the plaza Michelangelo and the discount mall. The rooms are rather small and unsafe. Some rooms are facing onto a construction site. The staff at the hotel had an unprofessional attitude towards guests. The hotel was quite noisy.",
      "This hotel seems older than its website's information suggests and is not recommended. Arriving by train makes it easy to access this hotel. It's ideally situated because you can access plenty of attractions by walking there but it's also really close to buses if wanting to go further afield. The rooms aren't big and some will face a construction site. Furthermore they aren't even safe. The staff were not terribly helpful and would keep people waiting during checking-in and checking-out. There was no apology after an incident and generally the hotel staff gave a no-care attitude. You get what you pay for in this hotel - the sound insulation was lacking and there were cigarette butts just left on the balcony.",
      "The hotel website doesn't portray the hotel very well and is older than the picture show. Some will be put off by this but it is a nice hotel. The hotel is in a great location, close to the bus station going to Fiosole, plaza Michelangelo and Florence for some discount mall shopping. It's perfect if arriving by train as is within walking distance from the station. Other attractions are also conveniently reachable by foot and the hotel has a good price. The rooms at this hotel are particularly small, apart from the handicap rooms. The views were also of a construction site which isn't the nicest. The service at this hotel is generally quite poor, with a no-care attitude towards its guests. The dining in the restaurant for dinner is equally as good. All for a decent price. For a cheap hotel, it isn't a bad quality. However the sound insulation could be better."

The rooms are very clean although the drain in the shower needs some attention.The hotel provided a good breakfast to guests. The hotel has good security, as your key card is needed to gain access to elevators or stairwells. There is free WiFi provided too. There was some street noise but not loud enough to cause concern. It is worth mentioning that it is difficult to park for the valet out front of the hotel.",

Rooms are spacious and cleaned to a good standard. The bed is especially nice, as it is very soft and four pillows are provided, regardless of whether one or two people are staying. The breakfast is super tasty here at this hotel. The hotel provides free WiFi which is great. There's added peace of mind here too because the room key needs to be used to access the elevator or the stairs, therefore providing added security to guests. There was little street noise, too, but there was some difficulty in getting valet parking though.",

The rooms were always very clean even if you turn up slightly early. The sheers are lovely and soft and there are plenty of pillows.

The location of this hotel is great for those wanting to get to the city centre, and all the amenities are in walking distance from the hotel which is very convenient. Beautiful rooms at this hotel, with a cosy fireplace for guests to enjoy. Very elegant whilst also providing guests with a comfortable bed. The food was simply amazing. Due to this hotel being an older build, there have been some issues with the air conditioning and the sink taps can be very tight. Not only this, but it is very easy to hear background noise as nothing seems soundproof."

The hotel is close to the theatre district with restaurants close by. It is situated close to Macy's, TJ Maxx and other shopping centres and the subway for easy travel. Rooms in this hotel are really nice and can't be recommended enough. The hotel only had one restaurant and a small bar, so the choices were limited. There is a free breakfast provided, but it is not advertised clearly. There is a charge to use the WiFi at the hotel and the fitness centre was not great.",

The rooms of the hotel are perfectly adequate, in particular the bathroom and linen. Extremely friendly and helpful at all times.

There are close by restaurants to choose from but also the subway station isn't far away for those wanting to go further on. The rooms are nice. The restaurant and small bar lacked availability of food options for guests, however they do serve a complimentary breakfast. There was a disappointing downside to this hotel in that you have to pay for WiFi access. There is a fitness centre but that is a little so-so."

      "This is overall a really great hotel but a bit pricey. It could be quite disturbing if you stay on the front of the hotel due to the horns from the street. The location of this hotel is absolutely great and central, you can walk to many shops, Gaudi 's Casa Batllo , and la Pedrera. The metro station is also really close. A standard room at this hotel is smaller than expected, with most of the space being taken by the huge but very comfortable bed inside. The bathrooms was outdated and need some updating. The room service was overpriced. Unfortunately the hotel's breakfast definitely not worth the money. The lifts were a bit inconvenient and request long time wait because there are only two of small and infrequent ones. Also, the rooms facing courtyard at the back are quieter than the ones to the front.",
      "This hotel may be the place you want to stay with each visit to Barcelona. It's not cheap but it is lovely. It's also popular with business travellers but the Spanish do like to beep their horns so staying at the front of the hotel could be noisy and disturbing and leave you disappointed. Being within close proximity of the metro line and only a short walk from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, la Pedrera, and even not far from Sagrada Familia, the location of this hotel is great. It is very centralised with many shops nearby as well. Overall, a fantastic location. The hotel rooms are an adequate size with a decent night's sleep to be had from the bed itself. The bathrooms are a little outdated and could do with a deep clean. The staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful. The hotel had a lovely pillow menu but breakfast was not worth the price paid. The front of the hotel can be loud so it is worth requesting a room facing the courtyard at the back and you may want to consider one of the lower floors to avoid having to take one of the two lifts. They are small and irregular in their arrival causing sometimes long wait times.",
      "The hotel, although a tad expensive, is a good option for a short stay in Barcelona. The front of the hotel can be noisy at time so ask for a room that is not facing the street. The hotel is situated near a metro line to get into central Barcelona. The hotel itself is a short walk from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, la Pedrera and just a little further to see La Sagrada Familia. The rooms are okay though on the small side at times. Bathrooms needed updating and some TLC but overall the rooms are good value due to the hotel's location. The hotel's staff was really very helpful. The hotel's breakfast was a bit basic and expensive for a 4 star hotel . The lifts in the hotel are a bit cramped and can take some time to arrive. The best rooms in the hotel are the ones facing the courtyard at the back, as the front side of the hotel can be noisy."

The room was spacious but was not as advertised online. The room was cleaned but there was a lingering smell and drug paraphernalia left there. The hotel staff were polite and accommodating. Even one of the porters managed to show us how to work all of the mod cons of the room as well. The breakfast was okay enough but the coffee from a machine was quite unpleasant. There is free WiFi here at the hotel and a great gym . The pool looks a bit different than pictures provided online and was on the smaller side therefore crowded. Overall though it is worth the money charged.",
      "This hotel provides a really impressive stay. The hotel is located within ten minutes walk from the beach and around five minutes away from a shopping mall and restaurants. The hotel is a little expensive for the location as it is not in the centre of Barcelona. The rooms are very unsatisfactory for the most part. Some are spacious but views are less than great, the room smelled of cigarettes and the representation of the rooms online was not accurate. The staff were polite and helpful but also really friendly and approachable when requiring help with any issues. The breakfast was okay but not much selection. The hotel's pool can be a bit crowded at times but the gym facilities are excellent.",
      "A very pleasant hotel to stay at, especially if visiting on business for a conference as many are held here. The location is convenient for the tram and subway but far from the character areas of Barcelona. But shopping and dining is close by and there is a beach within a 10-minute walk away. Average rooms at this hotel, that are spacious and reasonably comfortable. However, it noticeably smelt of cigarette smoke which wouldn't disappear, and the supposed sea views are quite poor. The staff at the hotel were all very helpful and friendly. breakfast was notable only in that it was monotonous and the coffee was from a machine. This hotel offers free WiFi as long as you check into their Facebook page each time you sign on. Also, there is a charge for towels at the pool but not a lot of room to sit. The hotel does have a good gym though."

The hotel is also close to a selection of restaurants. The rooms of the hotel are comfortable and affordable, but not big enough for more than two people. The air conditioning works well but the rooms can be unclean.The bar at the hotel is really reasonable and serves a really good Long Island iced tea.

The rooms are quite small if more than two people stay here and the carpets weren't clean at all. Additionally to that there were bugs in the fridge and throughout the room. There was air-conditioning and a television in this room and that does make the stay a bit more welcoming. The drinks prices were acceptable and the Long Island Iced Tea was satisfactory. The pictures on the website were not an accurate representation of the hotel . The bbq and the lagoon are both below acceptable standards.",

The rooms are too small and there are bugs in the refrigerator and the carpets need a good clean. The positives were that both the TV and the aircon worked fine and there was plenty of parking.

Although the location is noisy, you are unable to hear anything with the windows closed. The staff was knowledgeable about the city and the sights. This hotel offers ample breakfast but also drinks are available on the viewing deck, and the coffee is excellent. The hotel's roof garden is great."

      "This hotel is perfect for a mixed business/pleasure stay in Boston at any time of the year or season. It is reminiscent of vintage class when quality was key and mattered most. Travel the world and come back, this may be the favorite place. With a central location, the hotel is really convenient for the Arlington subway stop, and the Boston Common. If you politely request you can get a really great room on the eighth floor which is a King room. It's really big and has free breakfasts and appetisers as well as WiFi internet. Reasonable service at this hotel, with many members of staff very attentive to their guests. The security team were not so helpful but overall the staff seemed quite professional. Food-wise, the hotel does have, The Whiskey Bar, a hotel restaurant and seafood. They also had a special treat of Christmas Tea. The elevators were not working properly and kept getting stuck between floors."

The hotel also has a rooftop pool with a view of the sea too. The hotel is located near to the Port Olympic and Barcelonetta. There is also a fitness park a two minute walk away. The hotel room had a good bathroom, but the pillows and linen were a bit uncomfortable. The bed was a good size and there was a large TV, WiFi etc. The room was specious and clean and also had a sea view. The food was really good here especially the breakfast. Sometimes the restaurant did not open for dinner but the chef would be flexible for a small party, which is great. The pools were a great addition to this hotel as well at the fitness centre. There's even a Jacuzzi on the rooftop, which was really fun.",

This hotel is set so close to the beach that you will not need to walk too far. Additionally there are wonderful views from the top of the hotel, reminding you of what a great location you are staying in. The bed in the room didn't have the softest linen and the pillows weren't great either, but the bed itself was comfortable and everything was in good condition. There is WiFi in the room as well as a nice big television.The hotel had a lovely bar/restaurant overlooking Barcelona, but be warned that it can be expensive. Also note that the restaurant is not available every day, but they can be flexible in providing catering on request. The hotel has some great facilities. There are two pools, a rooftop Jacuzzi and a fitness centre all within the hotel.",

Beautiful, luxurious bathrooms that are in an excellent condition. All amenities are available in the rooms, and those on the higher floors have the luxury of stunning sea views. Wow!

If you don't mind cardboard towels and industrialized areas, this is the hotel for you.",

The location isn't particularly nice to look at it as it's industrial, however it is short walking distance to many of the main attractions in this area and the metro. The city centre is in close proximity also, when using public transport. These rooms are to a high quality. great for comfort and they have excellent views from the window. Everything needed is there to enjoy a quick stay. The cleaning staff were really great at what they do as they leave all areas immaculate they're so thorough. Good breakfast buffet that offers a selection of foods to start your day, catering for even the most fussy of eaters. Decent hotel, however the towels provided are of a poor quality and there are little views on offer due to it being in an industrial area."

Highly priced parking at this hotel, and the water provided is particularly dirty."

      "The resort will have you wanting to keep coming back because it is really relaxing and welcoming. The hotel was a short taxi ride away from the town centre. It was quite a drive to Duval Street and this was rather expensive in a taxi. The room was beautiful and has amazing views. With regards to the bed in the room it had great quilted bedding. You could not wish for better staff service here because it is five-star. They were really helpful as well as friendly and welcoming. There are some great salt pools where you can sip some cocktails and achieve some peace and tranquillity. The price is quite steep however there are four amazing pools and an outdoor bar, so would definitely come back again.",
      "The hotel resort is incredibly relaxing and a home away from home. The only downside is that it is quite expensive. This is a great tropical location but a taxi ride is usually required to get to most places. The hotel provides an ocean view to rooms on the upper floor. Also worth noting is the quality of the room's bedding. The staff were very welcoming and courteous and are highly recommended. The hotel provides cocktails in one of their three salt pools. The hotel has some pleasing features such as four swimming pools and porches areas, but the price can be expensive even if booked in advance.",
      "A resort with the perfect mix of relaxation, and a chance to catch up on some well needed sleep. This hotel is situated a short drive away from the busier, tourist areas that can be taken via taxi. However, the taxi to the downtown area is quite expensive. Ocean views were only available from the upper rooms due to the foliage but the cottages are great with really impressive bedding and the grounds are gorgeous. There are even little porches to enjoy. The staff was great. They were friendly and very helpful and went out of their way to make their guests feel at home. The hotel has little porches and you can relax in one or all of the four pools which also include an outdoor bar."

The room were clean but it seems more like a dorm than a hotel room. You need to spend extra 20 euro for an upgrade. Very friendly owners. While the breakfast is basic here the breakfast area is quite small and it gets filled up fast, there are lots of places near by; the staff will even make a reservation for you. The local boat trip to Murano is worth it but the advice would be to go on the normal boat.",

It is great once you get your bearings in Venice and is close to everything but the trip to Murano, though free, is not good. The room was clean with a good price for Venice. It was more of a dorm room than a hotel room away from the main hotel but we were eventually able to get a lovely room for an additional cost. The owners of this hotel were very friendly. The hotel offers a basic breakfast but the room is too small and fills quickly. There are places to eat nearby but you can also book a place in the restaurant. One boat tried was the size of a box so if going to Murano, go on the normal boat.",

And don't worry about being able to find it. It's no drama to locate and everyone will enjoy their stay. The hotel was well located and right on the Grand Canal. The hotel was located off of the beaten path so you can avoid a lot of tourists. The location was central for the main water boat routes too. The room was lovely, although across from the main hotel. It was a second floor corner room that was a bit smaller than anticipated, but at a good price and very clean. The owners of the hotel were welcoming. The hotel's breakfast was adequate although a little basic. The hotel can book the restaurant for you at your preferred time. The best way for hotel guests to go to Murano is by normal boat."

The staff will make any visit to this hotel really memorable.

The hotel's restaurant was good., but slightly expensive. The hotel were very helpful with pre-booking information, but check out of the stay was drawn out and frustrating.",
      "Everything you could need is only a short walk away from this hotel so it is is located in a great spot. There is also a rail station nearby as well if choosing to go further afield. The rooms are quite large . They are also spotless , quiet and really comfortable. The staff of the hotel were generally helpful and courteous, although the reception was sometimes less professional when dealing with issues. The restaurant provides really good meals even if the prices are a bit high. You can ask about checking in early but bear in mind that this hotel's checking out seemed to be quite long.",
      "Brilliant location for those looking to sight see, with most of the main attractions only walking distance from the hotel. The room had a great view of the city and some even had balconies. Not all of the rooms aren't big but are clean and comfortable. In general, the staff at this hotel are very nice and helpful. However, at times the service can be disappointing and customers can be made to feel like they are an inconvenience. Although the prices are quite expensive for the food at this hotel, it is a decent quality. Breakfast comes included in the rate which is a positive, however it is only the basic continental that you would get at many other hotels and nothing different or exciting to look forward to. The hotel offered a nice response when asked about early check-in, however, signing out took far too long and was frustrating."

Another positive is that the gym is perfectly adequate even if it is small.",

Additionally the evening cocktails overlooking the harbour are really recommended, too. The pool and gym facilities at the hotel were great but unfortunately the WiFi available had a charge.",

The location is one of the perks to staying at this hotel, with public transportation very close by for guests to go and sight see without the stress. The rooms in this hotel were too small and lacking in character or were plain although the bed was large and the views were very nice. The buffet breakfast was very nice. A variety of amenities on offer, including a swimming pool and gym, for the guests' pleasure. The pool in particular is delightful as it is based on the roof of the hotel.

This location was pleasant and located in a tree-lined avenue that was used by locals. The hotel room had a lovely view of the canal, with the rotunda and Stalingrad station in the background. A decent sized room with a large bathroom, although without a bath. Clean and tidy room with a comfy bed. Some of the staff at the hotel were helpful, but some had an unprofessional attitude. The hotel served simple French cuisine with a view of the canal, but the breakfast's hot items would go quickly. The hotel has secure parking available below the complex. It is worth nothing that one of the lifts may be out of order, so it takes a little longer to get the other lift.",
      "This hotel seems like it is brand new which is a plus. It is in a picturesque setting and is simplistically clean. The hotel is situated in a good location just outside Paris with two cafe bars nearby. The super clean room had incredible views of the canal and the boats there. Not only that but the beds were both large and really cosy. There was every facility you need apart from having a shower instead of a bath, but that's fine for most people. The staff are pretty helpful and at times they were extraordinary. The hotel offered a basic breakfast. There is secure parking underneath the hotel. There are also lifts provided, which can be a bit of a wait but there are also stairs to use.",
      "This hotel is a great option for those visiting Paris with a specific price range in mind, as it is a gem in what can be pretty bad accommodation in regards to this standard. The setting is lovely and really suited to its surroundings, making it a simple yet effective choice. Ideal location just on the outskirts of the main city, with multiple cafe bars close by for guests to enjoy if they fancy leaving the hotel. However, it is not in walking distance from the main station which can be off putting for some. The views from the rooms overlook the canals with its boats and looking onwards to the rotunda near the metro station in Stalingrad. There is also a good-sized bathroom with a great shower, though no bath and the room itself was clean and very large. The bed is comfortable and the rooms included all the expected facilities, an internet connection, and coffee or tea. The service was okay, as the staff generally try to be helpful where they can. But it could be better at times. The French food served nearby the hotel was simple but proper, it was a great place to eat. Sadly the hot but standard breakfast options were gone by a certain time in the morning. The hotel has the option of parking beneath the hotel and it is secured and although there were issues with the lift, stairs were available for use."

The tall ceilings in the rooms provide a larger feel to an otherwise average-sized room. However the furnishings are elegant and stylish therefore provide quite a charming feel to the room.

The Montreal Jazz Festival, as well as the entire Old Town, are also located within easy walking distance. This hotel was formally a bank. Rooms differ from one another but retain the elegant touches of its past. They are clean, comfortable and individual but not large, though the high ceilings give the illusion of spaciousness.

      "It was such a comfortable experience here at this hotel and nice bonus there was classical music that came from a nearby opera school. Excellent location for that is on a quiet street, but also allow easy reach for principal city sights; the metro and city tour bus stop are really close. Clean and large room with a great renovated bathroom. The staff are a wealth of knowledge about the nearby restaurants , side trips, which was was super helpful. The breakfast not only has lots of choice but the quality of the continental foods and drinks on offer was great. They also provide take away breakfast. No wireless internet in the rooms, only available in the lobby.",
      "The Oceania is a 2 - 3 star hotel but where it lacks in its grandeur it makes up for it with its staff. There is also the enjoyable music in the air from the nearby opera school and the hotel is not only comfortable but clean. The hotel's location is excellent. It lies just off of the Piazza della Repubblica on a quiet street and is close to buses and trains to allow reaching the city and sights easily. The hotel had a spotlessly clean, old double room with a great renovated bathroom. Breakfast was an ample continental breakfast with bread, pastries, juices, and coffee. it was lovely and you can get it to take away if you need to leave early. The Internet was only available in the lobby.",
      "The Hotel Oceania has classical music from the opera school below drifting up, which is very beautiful and atmospheric. The hotel is in an excellent location. It is situated on a quite side street close to Piazza della Repubblica, the metro and the principal sights of the city. The hotel's rooms are clean, spacious and with a renovated bathroom. A continental breakfast including breads, pastries, juices and coffee. There is the option to take away if needed. The hotel provided internet in the lobby,"

      "The hotel seems to be missing the personal details and it is perhaps slightly overrated. This hotel is beautifully set for walking to great sites of the city as well as shops and outdoor restaurants located close-by. The small complex that the hotel is located within had some beautiful orange trees as well, adding to the colourful neighbourhood. The rooms here are really lovely although were a bit noisy with doors banging. The breakfast buffet was really tasty if a little bit basic. The scrambled eggs are highly recommended. There was some noise coming from the bells of the nearby church therefore it is recommended to bring earplugs.",
      "This hotel provides a wonderful, cosy and convenient place to stay. It is a little pricey however it's really charming. The hotel is ideally situated for local restaurants, being only a stone's throw from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto too. The hotel is close to a tram link to the airport, Tivoli and other areas in Rome. It was great that the rooms opened onto the courtyards but this and the tiled floors made them rather noisy. The hotel's breakfast was adequate but was nice to enjoy in a courtyard of orange trees. It is worth mentioning that the bell chimes from a nearby church can clearly be heard in the rooms, which may be a negative for some guests.",
      "This hotel is a very nice and convenient base to explore Rome and the Vatican from but lacks a personal touch. It is cozy and charming but maybe overrated a little. This hotel is ideal for restaurants and in the middle of Trastevere and is only a block away from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto and within walking distance of the center of Rome, Campo Fiore and Janiculum. It is also not far from the tram with connections to the airport and there are lots of shops and beautiful colorful neighborhoods all around. The rooms are lovely in that there is the option for them to be opened out into the open air with the courtyards. However, the rooms can be become rather noisy due to the tilen floors and the doors that bang. There were not many staff here. Generally a very good buffet breakfast that offers scrambled eggs and cappuccino amongst other things. There is also access to the lovely courtyard that is covered in orange trees for when you want to eat your breakfast. The bells from the nearby church could cause sleep issues."

    "gen_A": "The Oceania hotel was recommended to us by Rick Steves and we couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. The hotel is in an excellent location, on a quiet side street just off the Piazza della Repubblica, close to the metro and a step-on, step-off city tour bus stop. The rooms in the hotel are spacious and clean, with a renovated bathroom. The bed was not very comfortable, but the owner of the hotel spoke English well and provided recommendations for restaurants. The internet access was not free.",
    "gen_B": "The hotel is a charming place to stay, tucked away in a small street in Trastevere but perfectly convenient for walking around Rome and St. Peter's. The area is not touristy and yet it is a maze of fascinating medieval streets with some of the best restaurants in Rome. The rooms in the hotel are noisy with banging floors and doors but the safety gates keep the noise out. Breakfasts were really tasty in the orange-tree courtyard. There is free internet available amidst the breakfast tables. The hotel staff seems scarce, with the couple serving breakfast later in the day cleaning the rooms.",
