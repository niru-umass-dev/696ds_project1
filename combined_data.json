      "This all suite hotel is flawless. Around the holidays season, the hotel was well decorated for X-mas with lovely Palm trees and Christmas lights. This hotel is so close to the beach and is perfectly located for peace and quiet. The airport and Duval street is only a short shuttle away, but downtown is quite far away. Morden rooms with great size and a lot of storage space. The beds are super comfortable. The bathroom is also pretty large with a nice vanity area. The staff were even willing to help with last minute late checkout request. The restaurant provides great food, but it closes too early for us. The hotel actually has bikes to rent. Parking close-by can be very pricey per day. The elevators feel not safe.",
      "Overall, as an all-suite hotel, the place was great. It's not the fanciest, but it was beautifully decorated for Christmas with lights on the palm trees and it was very enjoyable. The hotel is just across the street from Smather's Beach and is only a short walk, shuttle ride or bike trip away from Duval street. The rooms are large and spacious with lots of storage space and are clean with comfortable beds and also have a big bathroom. The vanity is very nice and the room is spacious enough to kick back in but also close to one of the few beaches in Key West. In the restaurant, the staff was very good. If at all possible the staff tried to accommodate late checkouts for all who requested it. Fantastic service. Although the restaurant closed at 9 and the bar also closed too early for the crowd, at 11. The food and staff was great. The hotel's elevators are not recommended to be used. Parking in the Duval Street area is pricey but the hotel has plenty of bicycles that are available to rent too.",
      "The hotel is well maintained, functional and the decor is good. The hotel has a public beach, Smathers Beach, across the road. Duval Street and downtown is only an hour away and you can take the shuttle there too. every hour. The hotel is also close to the airport, If you own a bicycle it is a great location too. They were comfortable beds in a spacious room . Lots of storage available and a modern and clean environment. A large bathroom in the room too. The hotel provided excellent food but the restaurant closes at 9pm which may be a little early for some tourists. The only complaint would be that the elevators are scary. Parking on Duval Street ranges between $10 and $35 per day but the hotel has bikes to rent so parking costs can be lessened or avoided."

It is situated only a 7-minute walk from the Colosseum and a 15-minute walk from the Trevi Fountain, with a range of restaurants close by and easily accessible transport options. The rooms are pleasant in terms of design, though they are quite small and the same is true of the shower. Most of the staff are proficient in English and can explain the hotel's services well. The cuisine served here is excellent and there is a nice coffee machine available, although the shower is too small to move around comfortably.",

Guests can choose between an apartment-style room away from the main hotel and a bigger room with a large bathroom within the hotel. Be conscious of the smaller beds and minor deficiencies on the sheets, however. Not all staff members can speak English fluently, but the majority can.

Coffee wasn't always available at the hotel, but when it was it was adequate. One complaint about the hotel is that there were people on the upper floors partying and made noise all night.",

Very comfortable rooms to stay in here, however the walls must be quite thin as it's easy to hear noises from other rooms close by. The staff were friendly and helpful.

However, there can be an issue with noise in some rooms as they are next to the delivery area and the heating/AC units can be very loud.

Extremely friendly and helpful staff at this hotel, who are very attentive to the needs of their guests and go above and beyond to make them feel welcome.

Furthermore, the shower was old and wobbly, and could spray wildly while heated to a very hot temperature.",
      "\n\nThis hotel is quite central and only a short walk away from memorable sites including the Leidsplein, the Herengracht canal, the Dam Square and Anne Frank's house. It is on a peaceful street located near the main avenue in the centre of Amsterdam. The room was sufficient for a short stay however it was rather small. The bathroom was great, spacious and with an excellent view of the canal. The staff were mostly polite and professional, although a few seemed somewhat casual and not as obliging. The quality and quantity of the breakfast provided could have been better. It seemed like some items were often not available and the price was fair. The shower in the bathroom streamed hot water but wasn't mounted properly. This issue was addressed when mentioned to the management."

The room was well arranged but could have been cleaner. The beds were comfortable but in poor condition. The shower room would leak outside the cubicle unless the shower head was positioned appropriately. In general, the staff of the hotel are very helpful and offer good service.

This hotel is located to everything you need in New Orleans and not far from Bourbon Street. The rooms were of an average quality, with rather basic furniture and facilities. The cleanliness of the rooms aren't to a very high standard either. The stay started off well because the valet staff are efficient and despite being really busy they maintained a friendly attitude. The front desk staff were also attentive and lovely, but the management let the staff down because they were clearly disinterested in tending to customers. The breakfast options were really limited to pastries and some coffee. Despite inexpensive rates and free parking this hotel is potentially dangerous; there are bed bug infestations that can leave you with huge itching welts.",

This hotel's location is unbeatable because there are lots of charming places to eat and lots of local classic sights are nearby. The rooms in this hotel are generally windowless, horrible and in bad condition. They were not very clean and the furnishings are in need of replacement. Management at this hotel was less than interested in customer service but the valet staff were prompt and friendly and front desk staff were prompt to help with a smile.

There are close by restaurants to choose from but also the subway station isn't far away for those wanting to go further on. The rooms are nice. The restaurant and small bar lacked availability of food options for guests, however they do serve a complimentary breakfast. There was a disappointing downside to this hotel in that you have to pay for WiFi access. There is a fitness centre but that is a little so-so."

Some of the rooms are luxurious and peaceful, boasting plush beds and a fireplace. The shower was wonderful, but the walls were quite thin. The hotel even offers a car service. The essence of the food was great, but the faucets in the bathrooms were slightly hard to maneuver and it was more apparent that there was no soundproofing due to the age of the building.",

The rooms were luxurious and even got a fireplace, but the walls were thin. The staff were accommodating and attentive to every need, including car service if needed. The food the hotel provided was of excellent quality. One thing worth noting is that the sink taps were too tight to use.",

Its proximity to the city centre and the fact that amenities are within walking distance is incredibly convenient.

The only problem is that it is an older build and therefore there have been issues with the air conditioning, and the sink taps are tricky to use. Additionally, soundproofing is lacking, making it easy to hear background noise."

The location of this hotel is absolutely great and central, you can walk to many shops, Gaudi 's Casa Batllo , and la Pedrera. The metro station is also really close. A standard room at this hotel is smaller than expected, with most of the space being taken by the huge but very comfortable bed inside. The bathrooms was outdated and need some updating. The room service was overpriced. Unfortunately the hotel's breakfast definitely not worth the money. The lifts were a bit inconvenient and request long time wait because there are only two of small and infrequent ones. Also, the rooms facing courtyard at the back are quieter than the ones to the front.",
      "This hotel may be the place you want to stay with each visit to Barcelona. It's not cheap but it is lovely. It's also popular with business travellers but the Spanish do like to beep their horns so staying at the front of the hotel could be noisy and disturbing and leave you disappointed. Being within close proximity of the metro line and only a short walk from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, la Pedrera, and even not far from Sagrada Familia, the location of this hotel is great. It is very centralised with many shops nearby as well. Overall, a fantastic location. The hotel rooms are an adequate size with a decent night's sleep to be had from the bed itself. The bathrooms are a little outdated and could do with a deep clean. The staff at the hotel were incredibly helpful. The hotel had a lovely pillow menu but breakfast was not worth the price paid. The front of the hotel can be loud so it is worth requesting a room facing the courtyard at the back and you may want to consider one of the lower floors to avoid having to take one of the two lifts. They are small and irregular in their arrival causing sometimes long wait times.",

The hotel is situated near a metro line to get into central Barcelona. The hotel itself is a short walk from Gaudi's Casa Batllo, la Pedrera and just a little further to see La Sagrada Familia. The rooms are okay though on the small side at times. Bathrooms needed updating and some TLC but overall the rooms are good value due to the hotel's location. The hotel's staff was really very helpful. The hotel's breakfast was a bit basic and expensive for a 4 star hotel . The lifts in the hotel are a bit cramped and can take some time to arrive. The best rooms in the hotel are the ones facing the courtyard at the back, as the front side of the hotel can be noisy."

Average rooms at this hotel, that are spacious and reasonably comfortable. However, it noticeably smelt of cigarette smoke which wouldn't disappear, and the supposed sea views are quite poor.

Despite this, the location of the hotel is quite valuable, as it is located in a central area with multiple shops, Gaudi's Casa Batllo, and La Pedrera nearby, not to mention the convenience of the Metro station. A complaint is that the standard size rooms are smaller than anticipated and a majority of the area is occupied by a large and somewhat comfortable bed. The bathrooms were outdated and the room service was expensive. Moreover, the breakfast did not justify its cost. There are only two slow and limited lifts, causing long queues for waiting.

Furthermore, it can be noisy at the front of the hotel due to the sounds of Spanish horns, so it's better to ask for a room at the back of the building. Likewise, it might be advisable to choose one of the lower floors to avoid having to use the small and unreliable elevators. The staff are friendly and attentive, and there is even a pillow menu.",

The rooms could use some refurbishment but are relatively decent for being in the heart of the city. The hotel staff showed great service and courtesy. The four-star hotel's breakfast spread was limited in selection and rather costly. Additionally, the elevators are a bit tight and can take a while.

The rooms here are cosy and on the small side but always very clean and comfortable enough. The staff were knowledgeable about the local area. The breakfast was fit for a king so that's definitely recommended. There was nothing not to like especially with breakfast on an open terrace. The hotel provides complimentary internet access in the reception.",

Everything is within walking distance from the hotel here including the public transportation, which you can take to get to the main street. The rooms in the hotel were a little small but clean and comfortable. There is no WiFi available in the room and not a lot of room for storage.

There was an unexpected bonus to this hotel and that is the reception area provides guests with free internet access.",
      "A highly recommended hotel that goes above and beyond for its customers, including arranged transfers to the airport and fruits and wine. With only a 5 minute walk to places like the Grand Bazzar or the center of Istanbul's old city, views of the Bosphorus this hotel sits in the old quarter and isn't far from popular tourist spots. It's rooftop terrace also offers views of the Golden Horn and the Blue Mosque and the sunsets are amazing from there. Although the size of the rooms here are small, they are well furnished, clean and comfortable. The only downside to the rooms at this hotel are that there is no wireless internet available unless you're in the lobby, and the rooms can seem quite dark to be in. The staff was okay.

Not to mention, the quality of the bedding is superb. Moreover, the staff have all been notably friendly and helpful, and they are highly recommended.

A decent sized room with a large bathroom, although without a bath. Clean and tidy room with a comfy bed. Some of the staff at the hotel were helpful, but some had an unprofessional attitude. The hotel served simple French cuisine with a view of the canal, but the breakfast's hot items would go quickly. The hotel has secure parking available below the complex. It is worth nothing that one of the lifts may be out of order, so it takes a little longer to get the other lift.",
      "This hotel seems like it is brand new which is a plus. It is in a picturesque setting and is simplistically clean. The hotel is situated in a good location just outside Paris with two cafe bars nearby. The super clean room had incredible views of the canal and the boats there. Not only that but the beds were both large and really cosy. There was every facility you need apart from having a shower instead of a bath, but that's fine for most people. The staff are pretty helpful and at times they were extraordinary. The hotel offered a basic breakfast. There is secure parking underneath the hotel. There are also lifts provided, which can be a bit of a wait but there are also stairs to use.",
      "This hotel is a great option for those visiting Paris with a specific price range in mind, as it is a gem in what can be pretty bad accommodation in regards to this standard. The setting is lovely and really suited to its surroundings, making it a simple yet effective choice. Ideal location just on the outskirts of the main city, with multiple cafe bars close by for guests to enjoy if they fancy leaving the hotel. However, it is not in walking distance from the main station which can be off putting for some. The views from the rooms overlook the canals with its boats and looking onwards to the rotunda near the metro station in Stalingrad. There is also a good-sized bathroom with a great shower, though no bath and the room itself was clean and very large. The bed is comfortable and the rooms included all the expected facilities, an internet connection, and coffee or tea. The service was okay, as the staff generally try to be helpful where they can. But it could be better at times. The French food served nearby the hotel was simple but proper, it was a great place to eat. Sadly the hot but standard breakfast options were gone by a certain time in the morning. The hotel has the option of parking beneath the hotel and it is secured and although there were issues with the lift, stairs were available for use."

This boutique hotel is perfectly located because it is on the edge of one of the greatest areas and away from tourist hordes, making it quiet. Despite the calm location it isn't too far away from good sight-seeing spots and there is no problem getting around the city. The rooms are well-maintained and clean, but there is quite a walk up to the room if staying on the top floor. . The breakfast is of the highest quality, and there is the option to eat in either the breakfast room or the roof terrace. The stay at the hotel was a little expensive.",

Most sites are walking distance from the hotel, yet the hotel itself is in a more remote location that offers guests peace and quiet if they choose it. The rooms are very well maintained and clean and though not as distinct as the public areas is unique in its own right. Some overlook the canal.Breakfast is little bit lacking but tasted good."
