It was a nice hotel, but didn't blow me away. My room was slightly smaller than average although it was clean and with a slightly more modern decor than a typical Fairmont. My one gripe is with the toilet. It's basically the kind of toilet you'd find in a public bathroom, with a flush that's located under the counter and hard to get to. I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus. Overall I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area or closer to Old Montreal.

Arriving from Toronto by train was just about as convenient as it could possibly be since the station is directly beneath the hotel. The room was fine, with a fabulous view up the hill to Mont Royal from the top floor. Service from the check-in staff was polite and efficient and they rapidly corrected some incorrect charges for using the mini bar which I had not done. The hotel does look a little dated and not much of the glamour from when John and Yoko staged their bed in remains, but all in all it's a good value and well-located place to stay in Montreal. Make sure you join the President's club via the fairmont website before arriving so that you get free wi-fi access.", "This is a very nice older, upper end, well maintained hotel. The front desk and concierge staff were very helpful and the housekeeping staff exceptionally friendly and accomodating.

I personally hate any bathroom where my knees block the door from closing when seated.

It's a functional business Hotel with all the room amenities, ( fast wi-fi in room, multi channel TV, Bath and shower, modern ( art deco) , nice roomy lobby etc. on most nights the restaurant was not open for dinner though the chef was flexible to prepare dinner for a small party per- arranged. We were not disappointed with the food. Tasty and well presented with generous portions Rooms are mid size and comfortable, but pricey ( it was GSM congress week, I guess).", "A great hotel for a weekend break. We thought the breakfast spread was excellent. Our room with a balcony and sea view was perfect and the sea breeze was lush. Everything was in good condition - smart bathrooms and good facilities. Only gripe would be crappy pillows and not the softest linen on the beds but i suppose one can always find something to complain about (or at least i can!) The kids with the families tended to stay downstairs in the lower pool area leaving the younger set (us) to chill by the more modern pool on the roof. The location was great as it's a minute form the beach and it's a short walk or cab into town. well recommended", "Very good hotel close to the party-beach-area: 1 minute walking! We got a room with sea view at 5th floor left wing which is great since the sun stays very long on the balcony. Distance to old town (picasso museum) is about 15 minutes onwards. Staff is superior: very friendly and very helpful! Fitness: fitness centre in the hotel is tiny but there is a fitness park about 2 minutes walking distance for 16eur/day which provide a good facility. Fun: we were using the jacuzzi on the roof top few times. Very cool sitting there, enjoy a glass of wine and overlooking Barcelona. I will be here again!", "Stayed at the hotel or 4 nights in August 2010. Everything about this hotel is 5 star and is a def hotel I wold stay in again if i stayed in barcelona.

I highly recommend the Pullman Skipper.", "Though one short block off the actual sand, the place has great beaches in both directions.

The staff could not not have been more helpful and kind, willing to give advice on sights, restaurants, bars etc. Having a pool, jacuzzi and sauna was great after a days sightseeing, although the pool was a wee bit cool!

The location is away from the city centre but by using the metro (Bogatell located around the block) you can be any where in the city in a very little time.

The location is great once you get your bearings in Venice. I would stay here again. Don't get room 107 though as it is literally in the breakfast area. We were on the second floor in a corner room.", "When we found this hotel on internet we couldn't even look at others. their website looks great and I was looking forward to discover if the reality raises up to the expectations. And it did.

All the staff could not have been more helpful with directions, sight seeing recommendations and restaurants. We had a blue room as we felt we needed a little bit of room and preferred a view of the Grand Canal We were certainly not disappointed. After a busy day shopping and sighteeing we would arrive back to our beautiful room with a bottle of vino, open our windows to the Grand Canal and watch Venetian life pass by, it was brilliant! The twin basin bathroom with beautiful chandeliers was a little luxury also when there is two of you.

I hope to one day return with my husband!", "The Huddos. Paynesville. Victoria. Australia We have returned to Australia after 6 weeks travelling overseas, we stayed at some wonderful places but our favorite place was Hotel Antiche Figure in Venice. Our stay was made so memorable by the receptionist who made us so welcome and looked after all our needs, the position right on the Grand Canal and the service. We stayed with two other couples and all agreed that we would recommend this hotel to all our friends back in Australia. The breakfast was fine and the rooms were very clean, one of our group had upgraded to a balcony room looking over the canal and l would recommend that it is well worth paying the extra for the view of all the activity that happens on the Grand Canal.", "The Hotel Antiche lives up to all of the positive reviews that have been written abuot it. The main advantage as far as I am concerned is its location right on the Grand Canal directly opposite the Santa Lucia railway station and within 100 metres or so of the main (only!) bus station. When you arrive in Venice the vast majority of travellers will arrive at one of these two locations. Then you are set loose into the MAZE that is Venice! When you witness the poor travellers who go round in circles trying to find their hotel, it is comforting to have a hotel that is located in such fine position. As for the accomodation itself, it has all been said previously.", "The hotel is located near the railway station on the relatively peaceful side of the canal. We loved the location because we could wander the back streets and avoid the hordes of day trippers and other tourists. We also used the vaporettos to explore Lido/Murano etc If you are mainly interested in St Mark's etc the hotel may feel a little remote. The corner canal view room we had was light, airy and exceptionally well maintained. Breakfast was great. The staff were first class. Another small elevator, however it seemed very well maintained - I took the stairs anyway !", "Upon checking in we were offered a choice of rooms and chose to stay in a corner bedroom on the top floor overlooking the Grand Canal which was awesome. The room was spacious clean and tidy with coffee/tea making facilities. The staff were extremely helpful and upon arrival gave us a map with ideas of places to visits and the best routes to take to the various sites. An excellent buffet breakfast was included. The hotel is situated opposite the Railway station with just one bridge to walk across with our luggage which was ideal. Would highly recommend this hotel", "We stayed in this delightful hotel for 4 nights, as an 18th birthday treat for my daughter. We had two lovely canal view rooms and the view was fascinating. The location was amazing. It was an easy walk to all of the main tourist attractions and when the feet were tired, it was central for the main water boat routes. It was extremely pleasant to sit outside in the evenings to enjoy a drink and to watch the gondoliers. I would have no hesitation at all in recommending this gem of a hotel.", "Fine hotel.very close to the train station which is great. Pretty far from the main tourist sights (i.e. San Marco Piazza).

The location is excellent and on the edge of one of the best areas of Venice and is well removed from the tourist hordes. The room was less distinct than the public areas but that is not to complaint. In many other hotels it would be excellent. It is expensive for it's size and services though, but I'm still very glad I stayed there. Don't pre book their river taxi from the airport: it is too expensive and a far more complex arrangement than simply getting a private water taxi at the airport on arrival. This is an excellent hotel.", "Good location; enough off the beaten track to be quiet and relaxing but a great short walk to Accademia and other sites. If you like exploring places on foot its ideal. If you don't, the Vaporetto is on the door step and we had no problem getting anywhere in the city and the islands using it. Hotel was our kind of place; good style mixture of contemporary blending with the traditional with a couple of quirky bits thrown in (the light sconces in the lounge!). Very friendly and helpful, low key staff. Room was well maintained, clean and pleasant. Breakfast was simple but excellent (and filling). Would definitely go back there if staying in Venice again.", "The Ca Maria Adele is ideal in every respect. It sits on a quiet little canal just behind the magnificent Chiesa di Santa Maria and not far from the Accademia. The staff was very friendly, treated its guests with real coridality and were brimming with suggestions and assistance. Breakfast was especially satisfying in a tall room that spangled with Venetian ornament. The hotel felt very personal, it was like staying at the home of a friend. Who should stay here? Couples, old or young, families, no matter the size, single folk, businessmen. I look forward to going back to Venice and when I do so staying at the Ca Maria Adele. Recommended without any reservation whatever.", "Just stop searching for the perfect hotel in Venice because this is the one. Right next to the Salute is an idyllic spot with just twelve rooms. The staff are without exception helpful and no request is too small. The breakfast is a delight and can be served wherever suits your mood and the hotel has wonderful touches throughout. Each room is individualised and ours overlooked the canal. A minute from the vaparetto stop and close to a number of super Art Galleries . Lovely little restaurant was recommended and did not disappoint. Take the Water Taxi transfer - the only way to travel.Just ignore the tariff it is worth every penny. Enjoy.", "Loved this small hotel, with a great location on the Grand Canal and right next door to the Salute Church. The staff were polite and very helpful, no problems with the English language. Will never forget the Saturday night when the Salute bells were ringing followed by all the church bells around Venice. Close to San Marco Square. If you stay on the top floor be ready for a walk up the stairs to your room.", "Paying attention to every detail, this hotel was an experience of its own. The White Room on the bottom floor was spectacular, the room service was top notch, the views from all points of the hotel were nearly fantastical! Breakfast was delicious (though one staff member seemed absolutely miserable with her job) and the always stocked minibar was so refershing during the hot summer days!", "We loved the Ca Maria Adele. The hotel staff and owner were so attentive. The room was incredible and so so charming. We were greeted by champagne and passion fruit within 5 minutes of walking into our hotel. The breakfast room and the meal itself were just great. All the recommendations given by the hotel staff were awesome. Would LOVE LOVE to go back.", "This is one of the best deals in Venice. The price is a little high, but well worth it. This boutique hotel is in a relatively quite spot and still only a stop or 2 from San Marco."], "source_reviews_b": ["Everything is of superb quality in this hotel and you can really see the thoughts they put into each detail - from the light switch to where the sockets are placed. We went for the highest room (Casa Nova) in the hotel which has a sky window that opens up to see the sky at night, it was very romantic. Breakfast was truly a gem - the croissants are made fresh and they tasted super delicious. There are only two tables that are out on the balcony so people have to wait for the outdoor tables. They offer free water taxi rides to the glass factory on Murano island, but it was a complete waste of time. Transport organized by the hotel to the island was perfect, but the hotel didn't arrange our transportation back and we were stuff with like 10 other people in small boat which made us completely soaked on our way back. The boat did not stop back at our hotel but just dropped us off, all soaked, at St. Mark's Square. It was the worst boat ride. Avoid the hotel's free ticket to Murano at all, you can better spend your time in Venice doing something else.", "We had originally booked our rooms at the Hotel Antiche Figure, however when we arrived at the hotel the manager told us that he had another hotel that they were attempting to fill with guests right down the street, it was another property that they owned that had recently opened up. .He told us that if we wanted to stay there instead of the Antiche Figure he would upgrade everyone's rooms. When we saw the property and the rooms, we just couldn't say no. The manager put us in four incredible rooms beautifully decorated in an antique Venetian style, yet with very modern facilities. ie Wireless. flat screen tv's hidden behind mirrors etc, plus the rooms had amazing views onto the canal, or the square. which was wonderfully quiet. This place is beautiful. I would highly reccomend staying here. especially if you are American. the service of the staff is completely up to par with American standards. and on that matter they excel on sevice standards.", "I love it when Tripadvisor reviews point me in the right direction. Venice was one of the stops on my honeymoon and the staff, amenities, and location of Hotel Canal Grande does not disappoint! From the check-in, Gianni welcomed us with a detailed map, suggested walking paths, and a little joke: \"call this number and we can come get you. free! if you call after 10pm, we will think you are drunk and we will come get you.for a charge.\" Here are other highlights: - free wifi - free bottle of prosecco on the house - free hotel breakfast (which you can eat on the terrace, watching the boats go by) - modern amenities which complement seamlessly with the rococco interiors - excellent service (when we couldn't find the local laundromat, they sent an employee of a *sister* hotel to check that it was open and then escort us there- fabulous!)", "Convenient location to everything and easy to find. Make sure to print out directions to the hotel for your arrival. The rooms were elegant and comfortable. Nice breakfast in the morning. The staff were pleasant and very helpful. Our last night there our neighbours were noisy and vulgar, the staff did try and control the situation and more than compensated us the next day. Despite this we wouldn't hesitate to stay again.", ".what the other reviewers say. Just book & enjoy, if you can. The only negative experiences from our 2 nights in the Doge room was a somewhat unpleasant and unhelpful interaction with the night clerk, and a another situation in which some other employee spent ages finding information on the vaporetti schedule that in the end were just plain wrong. Still 4/5 for service, as the rest of the staff were marvelous.", "I stayed 3 nights in Canal Grande. A gem in Venice, near Piazzale Roma where i parked my car, near a vaporetto stop, great staff, great breakfast and great room \" Accademia\". If you are looking for a hotel to stay in Venice, dont think about it.Stay in Canal Grande. Perfect!", "Simply the best hotel we've ever stayed at! Great location, great room, great view, great breakfast. Unbelievable value. The management and staff made us feel so welcome, without a doubt we would return again.

We stayed at this location three nights and were able to walk comfortably to all major sights without problem. I will not rave about this hotel, but I found nothing materially wrong with it either.
