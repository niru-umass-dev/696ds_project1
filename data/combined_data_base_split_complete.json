They took up the whole side of the bar and most of Angela's time. They sounded like they frequent the pool often. The question to the management is whether the bar and pool are for the use of the hotel guests or the local kids. It was a big mistake. We are the ones that pay for the rooms. Maybe you want to reconsider the use of the pool/bar. The pool/bar should be for guest use. So far this is the only glitch. It's a wonderful stay. The staff is courteous.

My husband surprised me with dinner at nearby Quay. The surprise happened in November 2010. It was everything you'd expect from a five-star hotel. There was a huge bed. There were plush robes. There were gorgeous toiletries. There was a view to die for. It lacked the personality you'd get from a smaller boutique hotel. The wi-fi wasn't free. It surprises me in this day and age. Should you not expect it from a hotel? You're paying top dollar. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room. We enjoyed everything the Sydney Harbour foreshore had to offer. We had drinks and dinner. We took walks along the promenade. It's a good place to stay in terms of location. If you're close to Circular Quay, you can get anywhere you like. You can get anywhere you like on buses, trains, ferries, and even water taxis.", "We stayed here for a few nights. We went to Sydney. The location is good if you want to be near the rocks. The location is very far from China town or other pubs if you are into night life. We paid extra for the opera house/harbour bridge view room. The view was partially blocked by nearby buildings. We could hardly see the bridge. The room was very tiny. There were no slippers provided. The speaker stayed at the Four Seasons in Shanghai a few years ago. The speaker recently stayed at a place that was worse than the Four Seasons in Shanghai. The comparison is being made between the recent stay and the previous stay at the Four Seasons in Shanghai. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. It is not up to standard in comparison with other Four Seasons around the world.", "The room was fairly small. The room was plain. The room lacked the \"wow\" factor. We have experienced the \"wow\" factor at some other Four Seasons properties. It was the least expensive Four Seasons we've stayed at. The view was fantastic. The Opera House was visible from the view. Circular Quay was visible from the view. The Harbour Bridge was visible from the view. The Rocks District was visible from the view. Our room package included a buffet breakfast each morning. The buffet breakfast was wonderful. Highly recommended. The gym is small but adequate. The gym was never crowded when we were there. The pool area is located up on the roof. The pool area is pretty. The service was excellent. The service was unfailingly prompt and helpful. ", "I recently spent 4 nights at this hotel. It was during my honeymoon. My first impression was that this is an average hotel. My first impression was that this hotel is not up to a four seasons standard. The rooms were too small. The rooms were very bland. There is a pool. There is a gym. Both the pool and gym were good. The best part of this hotel is the location. I guess that is what I paid for.
