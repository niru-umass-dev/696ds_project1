They took up the whole side of the bar and most of Angela's time. They sounded like they frequent the pool often. The question to the management is whether the bar and pool are for the use of the hotel guests or the local kids. It was a big mistake. We are the ones that pay for the rooms. Maybe you want to reconsider the use of the pool/bar. The pool/bar should be for guest use. So far this is the only glitch. It's a wonderful stay. The staff is courteous.

The classical music was drifting up. The opera school was on the level below."], "source_reviews_b": ["I feel the hotel is overrated. The hotel is slightly overrated. The setting is fine. There are lovely orange trees in the nice courtyards of the smallish complex. The rooms are noisy. The floors are tiled. The doors are banging. However, this is the case. The room window gives unto the open tilen pathway. The open tilen pathway leads past the doors. Breakfast is ok. Breakfast is basic. There is free internet available. The internet is amidst the breakfast tables. Staff seems a little scarce. The couple serves breakfast later in the day. The couple cleans the rooms. Something is missing. The missing thing is the loving hand. All flowers are made of plastic. Even the azaleas and cyclamen outside in the garden are made of plastic. This is given as an example. The personal touch seems missing. That is a pity.", "Hotel Santa Maria is a delightful, cheery & quiet place to stay. It is tucked away in a small street in Trastevere. Antonio (manager) is molto simpatico. He is friendly and very helpful. The hotel is not a fancy place. The hotel is quite comfy enough. There is a good breakfast buffet. You can eat the breakfast in the lovely courtyard. The courtyard is full of orange trees. The colorful neighborhood is great for walking around. There are lots of shops and outdoor restaurants.

The cleaning/cooking staff is wonderful. The rooms are very clean. Breakfasts were very filling and tasty. The scrambled eggs were my favorite. The cappuccino was my favorite. The neighborhood is not touristy. 15-minute walk to the Colosseum; 25 min. to St. Peter's. They arranged a driver. The driver is for airport pickup and dropoff. Bells of neighboring Church could be sleep-disruptive for light sleepers. Earplugs blocked the noise. ", "Accomodating people who are always pleasent. The breakfast was good. The hotel is located a block from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto. The hotel is tucked away from all bustle. We walked to the center of Rome. We walked to Campo Fiore. We walked to Janiculum. We walked all over Trastevere. The location is close to #8 tram. The tram has connections to the airport, Tivoli, and all of Rome. There is a private courtyard. The courtyard is accessed through a gated drive. It is a refuge. It is good for tired feet and bodies. We would go back. (This sentence cannot be further split as it is a simple sentence.)

The staff was very nice. I would stay here again.", "The stay was for 4 nights. The place was a lovely oasis of calm. The location was in Trastevere.

It is very convenient for the Vatican. The rooms opened out into the open air. The open air was the courtyards. The courtyards were lovely.", "This was a charming refuge from the overload of Rome. The refuge was somewhat pricey. The employees were wonderful. The setting was very peaceful. The location was very handy. I would definitely stay here again."], "gen_a": "The Oceania hotel was recommended to us by Rick Steves and we couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. The hotel is in an excellent location, on a quiet side street just off the Piazza della Repubblica, close to the metro and a step-on, step-off city tour bus stop. The rooms in the hotel are spacious and clean, with a renovated bathroom. The bed was not very comfortable, but the owner of the hotel spoke English well and provided recommendations for restaurants. The internet access was not free.", "gen_b": "The hotel is a charming place to stay, tucked away in a small street in Trastevere but perfectly convenient for walking around Rome and St. Peter's.
