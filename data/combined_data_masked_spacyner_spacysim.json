Our room was first class . The hotel was excellent value , the breakfast buffet was unlimited and varied and the service could not be bettered . The situation for a tourist could not be more convenient as it is so central and most sites can be walked to within minutes . When transport is required the Grand Canal is 5 minutes away . As the hotel has no restaurant it is necessary to eat out ( no bad thing when visiting a new city ) and the recommendations of the concierge can be trusted .

It was quiet and quaint and the hotel staff was very friendly . We first got taken to a room across the bridge from the main hotel ( 1st floor ) that seemed more like a dorm room than a hotel room . We asked to be changed into the main hotel and they showed us two rooms to look at . The first one was the size of a box but the second one was great . The location is great once you get your bearings in Venice . I would stay here again . Do n't get room 107 though as it is literally in the breakfast area .

We stayed with two other couples and all agreed that we would recommend this hotel to all our friends back in Australia .

The main advantage as far as I am concerned is its location right on the Grand Canal directly opposite the Santa Lucia railway station and within 100 metres or so of the main ( only ! ) bus station . When you arrive in Venice the vast majority of travellers will arrive at one of these two locations . Then you are set loose into the MAZE that is Venice !

We were in a ' discovery room ' decked out with flock wallpaper , beautiful yellow drapes and lovely large bath . Even though the decor was dramatic , the room was very easy to relax in and had all the mod cons needed to do so . The room came with a flat screen tv , ipod dock , safe , minibar and fluffy bathrobes . All in all a prefect romantic weekend hotel . It 's in a great part of town - right behind the Musee D'Orsay ( and its railway station ) and surrounded by many great restaurants and pattiseries .", "I stayed at this hotel during the second half of my trip to Paris in October 2009 . I absolutely loved being steps away from the D'Orsay and the Seine . The Christian Lacroix designs were probably too haute couture for my tastes but the bed was comfortable , sheets were luxe , and the room was spacious enough . Loved having a bath tub but one should note that the shower head is a hand held . I had breakfast twice and both times , I was the only one dining in the breakfast room . If you plan on visiting the D'Orsay ( which you should ) , be sure to secure your ticket at the front desk . The hotel ticket allows you to skip the line .", "Excellent hotel for a short stay ( 2-4 nights ) . Great spot , great value for money , very stylish . Advice : If you ring them they will give you the room you want , some are a little ' too ' stylish than others . The one with the pink stripes at the front of the building was excellent . Downfall : Room was a tad small , but made up for it in covenience and charm . I would n't let that put you off for a short stay .", "I love the work of the french designer Christian Lacroix , each room is different , full of warm colors , specially the red ones . The hotel is situated just near the Musee d'Orsay and few minutes walk from Saint Germain area . I can recommend it for business stay or for lovers , the staff is very helpfull and friendly for giving advices or nice places to visit in Paris . Try to take at least once , the breakfast , generous and full of organic products .", "This hotel is being advertised as \" entirely decorated by the famous designer Christian Lacroix \" . except bizarre wallpapers I really do n't know why this hotel would be named \" chic and trendy \" .

Highly recommended ."], "source_reviews_b": ["Just spent one night at the Holiday Inn , and to be honest , it 's the best option on that price range . Lovely setting , and the Pompidou ' Paris Plages ' really suited the setting . Chilled out area by the canal with a fab place to eat opposite the entrance , that served proper French simple food . Room spotless , and although when we went to bed we could still hear music , it did n't really bother us . The breakfast was standard , and there were hot options , they were gone by the time we went down . A previous poster mentioned one of the lifts being shut off , and we experienced this , but it did n't impede our stay any - who cares about waiting an extra minute for a lift - if you 're that bothered , then use the stairs ! Paris can be pretty bad for accommodation of this standard , and this is a gem . The Metro is less than 5 minutes away , and it 's nice to be in a part of Paris that is not touristyy at all .", "The hotel is 4 minutes from the metro with a handy all night store en route . The staff were very friendly and efficient and I would recommend thi hotel with its lovely views and large comfortable rooms . My room looked all the way up the canal towards the rotunda near the Stalingrad metro station and overlooked the houseboats moored in the canal basin . The tree lined avenue alongside was used by the locals to play boules and the two cafe bars nearby were ideal for a late night drink / coffee . Easy access to Paris by metro and a real feeling that you were not surrounded by tourists but were seing a genuine slice of French life . I would not hesitate to recommend the hotel although some people might not like the walk from the station at night as it is quite dark ( albeit it is past the police station ) .", "My wife and myself spent 5 days in this hotel from 12th May 2009 and found it to be an exceptional hotel in a lovely location just outside Paris . Our delightful room was overlooking the canal with a view of boats as they plied their way down he canal . Brilliant shower in the good size bathroom , no bath , but this not important to ourselves . Large and very comfortable bed and room had all the facilities you would expect from this hotel group including internet connection , tea and coffee etc . Very adequate breakfast served in dining room and staff were very helpful . We used the excellent public transport system , always a good way to get about Paris , and there was a very convenient Metro station close to the hotel .", "We booked a room 2 months ago . When we arrived last saterday , they were suddenly ' overbooked ' . They said the'll send us to a different hotel , they gave us a map en showed us how to walk . When we came to the other hotel , they did n't no nothing about us . The hotelstaff send us to the wrong hotel ! After a whole afternoon walking around the nieghbourhood , we finally checked in at the right hotel . A waste of our afternoon , since we stayed only a view days in Paris . We are certainly not happy with the serive at the hotel , you do n't treat your guest like that and only say a simple ' sorry ' afterwards .", "My wife and I stayed at this hotel for a weekend for our anniversary . The hotel was well located to experience Paris without paying the high prices . We purchased a 3 day Visite Paris pass which allowed us unlimited travel on the metro , RER , Bus etc . to visit all the main attractions . The pass also entitled us to a 20% discount on the Euro Disney tickets and the travel there and back ! I highly recommend this hotel for a great weekend away .", "This seemed a brand new hotel .

There were not enough seats in the restaurant , so be ready to wait for some time during rush hour .", "Who would have thought that a H.I. Express could be so enjoyable .

Breakfast was truly a gem - the croissants are made fresh and they tasted super delicious . There are only two tables that are out on the balcony so people have to wait for the outdoor tables . They offer free water taxi rides to the glass factory on Murano island , but it was a complete waste of time . Transport organized by the hotel to the island was perfect , but the hotel did n't arrange our transportation back and we were stuff with like 10 other people in small boat which made us completely soaked on our way back . The boat did not stop back at our hotel but just dropped us off , all soaked , at St. Mark's Square . It was the worst boat ride .

When we saw the property and the rooms , we just could n't say no .
