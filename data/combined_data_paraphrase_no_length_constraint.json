The hotel is in a great location, on a peaceful street yet with easy access to the main attractions in the city; the metro and city tour bus stop are right nearby. Our room was large and clean, with a recently remodeled bathroom. The staff was extremely knowledgeable about the restaurants nearby and any side trips we could take, which was immensely helpful. Breakfast had lots of options, and the quality of the continental food and beverages was excellent. There was also the option to take away breakfast.

The orange trees in the area add a pleasant brightness and colour to the neighbourhood. The rooms themselves are attractive, although the doors are quite loud and bang easily. The included breakfast is simple but delicious, with the scrambled eggs being something to highly recommend.

It's really charming and in a fabulous location, super close to Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto with a quick tram link to the airport and to other areas in Rome. The rooms are well-situated on the interior courtyards, though the tiled floors made them a bit noisy. Breakfast was fine but nice to have outside under the orange trees. It should be noted that the sound of a nearby church bell can be heard in the suites, which some guests may not appreciate.", "\n\nThis hotel has a great location for exploring Rome and the Vatican, with many shops and picturesque neighborhoods nearby.

Despite being very soundproof, the rooms can be a bit loud due to the occasional creaky floors and slamming doors, but luckily the safety gates help block out the noise. Breakfasts offered at the hotel are particularly delicious and the spacious orange-tree courtyard provides the perfect spot for relaxation while you take advantage of the free Wi-Fi.
