I'm sure the prices are higher than other hotels , but I feel we get what we pay for . I do think the boat could be a little better as far as the food they serve . etc... . I look forward to this as a weekend spot every year for my convention and while I am only an hour away after the weekend we feel like we have had a mini vacation . I wouldn't change one thing about my stay except that I would love to be able to stay a week . I look forward to this years convention and the fun times my kids will have", "The Shrek the Halls display was very cool (no pun intended). It's quite chilly, but very neat to see all the figures made of ice. The ICE attraction with the snow was very simple.

It is truly a top end hotel from the well appointed lobby, excellent restaurant, beautiful guest suites and most important of all 5 star pulse customer service. Every staff member greets you with a pleasant smile and no request is considered too small. I stay in La Grande Residence where the one and two bedroom fully equipped suites make your stay, wether it is only a few days or a couple of weeks, relaxed and stress-free. The staff are so customer oriented that they always greet yu by name when you call the front desk and make you feel welcome on arrival by saying \"Welcome back to the Sutton Place\". The beds are very comfortable, you get an excellent sleep. The hotel is the preferred location for many Hollywood actors and crew shooting in Vancouver but the hotel staff treat every guest just as if they were an Oscar winner!", "Sutton Place hotel was a great stay! The location at Burrard and Robson makes it super convenient for shopping and eating - lots of great locations around. Service was spot-on from all the staff. The hotel is a bit old but everything was still clean and renovated. Rooms were roomy and beds really comfortable. I only have 2 complaints - the parking is outrageous (40$ per night), and the hotel charges for internet (20$ per day). I think the hotel would be much better value if they would eliminate or lower some of these charges! Can definitely recommend this hotel for anyone wanting to stay in downtown Vancouver!", "I stayed at the Sutton Place Vancouver for a 4-night business trip. During my stay I, unfortunately, came down with a really bad cold, so I used Room Service, which was excellent. I also ate in the dining room (excellent service).

Convenient walk to shops, restaurants and the stunningly beautiful Vancouver Convention Centre. Very, very comfortable bed. (No back pain, yay!)", "We stayed here for 5 nights in a grand suite.

Enjoy.", "Loved this small hotel, with a great location on the Grand Canal and right next door to the Salute Church. The staff were polite and very helpful, no problems with the English language. Will never forget the Saturday night when the Salute bells were ringing followed by all the church bells around Venice. Close to San Marco Square. If you stay on the top floor be ready for a walk up the stairs to your room.", "Paying attention to every detail, this hotel was an experience of its own. The White Room on the bottom floor was spectacular, the room service was top notch, the views from all points of the hotel were nearly fantastical! Breakfast was delicious (though one staff member seemed absolutely miserable with her job) and the always stocked minibar was so refershing during the hot summer days!", "We loved the Ca Maria Adele. The hotel staff and owner were so attentive. The room was incredible and so so charming. We were greeted by champagne and passion fruit within 5 minutes of walking into our hotel. The breakfast room and the meal itself were just great. All the recommendations given by the hotel staff were awesome. Would LOVE LOVE to go back.", "This is one of the best deals in Venice. The price is a little high, but well worth it. This boutique hotel is in a relatively quite spot and still only a stop or 2 from San Marco."]}, {"split": "test", "entity_a": "292894", "entity_b": "292894", "entity_a_name": "Hotel Oceania", "entity_b_name": "Hotel Oceania", "entity_a_uid": ["UR37650228", "UR122756295", "UR8703059", "UR3925793", "UR114093264", "UR128066405", "UR29857063", "UR11027429"], "entity_b_uid": ["UR37650228", "UR122756295", "UR8703059", "UR3925793", "UR114093264", "UR128066405", "UR29857063", "UR11027429"], "refs_a": ["It was a comfortable experience at this hotel.

The location is excellent, on a quiet side street just off the Piazza della Repubblica, close to the metro and a step-on, step-off city tour bus stop. We were able to easily reach the principal city sights from there. Our room was large and very well appointed (and I love that 1940s style elevator to get you there!) The staff was excellent, very helpful. (I had trouble backing up some photos from my camera to a flash drive and they assisted me.) There are a number of very good restaurants nearby so you dont have to fight the tourist hordes around the Spanish Steps or the Fountain of Trevi. Well go back when were in Rome.", "This is a cozy, tucked-away retreat from the busy streets of Rome. Our room was quiet and the owner was attentive and helpful (spoke English well). The breakfast room is a warm and inviting setting with a decent variety of food. The bed was not very comfortable (although I am extremely picky) but every other part of our stay was enjoyable. We stayed at this location three nights and were able to walk comfortably to all major sights without problem. I will not rave about this hotel, but I found nothing materially wrong with it either. This is a typical 2-3 star hotel and makes up for its lack of \"grandness\" by having a fantastically helpful and friendly staff.", "We stayed two nights at this hotel. We found the staff very friendly, and helpful. Our room was clean and of a good size. If you want to experience true italian culture, then this family is for you. The breakfast was continental, and very good and ample. If you want scrambled eggs and bacon when you are in Europe, then stay home. If you want to enjoy the culture you are in then ask this facility for recommendations for restaurants, side trips, etc., they are more than accommodating. We will definately use this hotel on our next visit.", "We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay in Oceania. We had a double room that was spotless and also quite spacious.
