The rooms are clean and quiet, although for a more updated room it is worth booking a room on the Club floor. There is nothing the staff find to be too much trouble. The buffet breakfast is absolutely amazing and really varied. In addition the restaurant provides some really good food that's worth trying. The hotel has a bi-hourly bus shuttle service available to guests. It is not worth getting a hotel with a pool as it is often not the climate for swimming etc.",This is such a great hotel it's highly recommended and you won't regret booking again and again.
