This hotel is ideal for those who want to get away from the hustle and bustle of life; it lies in close proximity to the beach and is set up perfectly for peace and quiet. Its suites boast modern decor, ample storage space, comfortable beds and large bathrooms with nice vanity areas. Not only that, the staff are accommodating and willing to help with last minute late checkout requests. The food in the restaurant is top-notch but unfortunately shuts down early. The hotel even has bikes available to rent, however, finding parking nearby may be costly. Lastly, the elevators leave much to be desired in terms of safety. Esthetically during the holidays, this all-suite hotel was decorated to perfection with Christmas lights and palm trees.","

This hotel was somewhat pricey and its cleaning standards were just passable. Unfortunately, it's not in a great spot because it's away from the old town - home to some of the better attractions. On the plus side, however, it's away from the hustle and bustle. The staff was not particularly friendly or helpful. Breakfast can be had at the outdoor restaurant, which can be quite nice, and if you are a Florida resident you may be able to get a discounted rate. The pool and hot tub are worth checking out.

The hotel has a pleasant atmosphere and is reasonably priced, making it an ideal option if you're looking to get to the many activities and attractions located nearby. However, the street on which the building is situated can be quite noisy. The quaint rooms are cozy and tidy, but slightly limited in size, plus the beds are roomy. The room also has an open atmosphere thanks to its thatched roof, though this means that sound insulation is not present. Breakfast is available to eat in the garden or takeaway, however, the hotel does not have a parking facility.","

The Yucatan province is made even more special because of the hotel's presence in the area and its clear difference from the commercial ones like Cancun. Highly appraised food is served here and thereby becomes worth the repeated visits. The location is well-suited for those who prefer to shop and grab a bite nearby. Though the rooms in the hotel come with only basic amenities, their showers are in good functioning. As a nice touch, their towels are formed into animals shapes.

This place is great for a brief stay, so you likely won't want to leave! Although it is not located particularly close to the city centre, the area is secure, so its location is fairly good. The rooms in the hotel are contemporary, plus you can get a free cup of coffee from the barista. There is a coffee maker also available. You do have to pay 12 pounds per night for parking. It is noteworthy to mention that one of the receptionists appeared unhelpful when an occurrence happened at the hotel.","

It is located close to the Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque, and tram lines, providing you with easy access to the city. The rooms are usually comfortable, however, this one in particular was filled with smoke from the lobby. The hotel staff proved to be helpful, and breakfast is included in the rate.

The accommodation is decent, though a bit too darkly lit, but it is clean and tranquil. For a more modern room, it is recommended to reserve a room on the club floor. The hotel workers are more than willing to help with any inquiries. In addition, the breakfast buffet is remarkable in variety and taste, as well as the in-house restaurant that is definitely worth trying. There is a bi-hourly bus shuttle service for guests.

Inside the room, the bathroom was of good quality; however, the bed linens and pillows were a bit uncomfortable. The bed was large, and the room had a internet, a good sized TV and a sea view.

In conclusion, the accommodation was satisfactory and this unique establishment has my endorsement. It is conveniently located for sight-seeing trips to the city as well as for tranquil strolls and jogs along the waterfront in the vicinity. The nearby eateries and delis are favourite hang-outs among locals. However, some rooms contain unenclosed toilets which could be problematic. Furthermore, guests can access WiFi connection without any charges. Unfortunately, the staff can be impolite and did not provide quality service.

Breakfast passes only implicate fruit and bread. There is a pricey parking facility at the hotel, priced at $18, plus the water has an off-putting discoloration and is filled with seaweed.","

Visiting the resort is an experience one could never forget due to its serene and inviting atmosphere.
