This hotel is so close to the beach and is perfectly located for peace and quiet. The airport and Duval street is only a short shuttle away, but downtown is quite far away. Morden rooms with great size and a lot of storage space. The beds are super comfortable. The bathroom is also pretty large with a nice vanity area. The staff were even willing to help with last minute late checkout request. The restaurant provides great food, but it closes too early for us. The hotel actually has bikes to rent. Parking close-by can be very pricey per day. The elevators feel not safe.","Overall, as an all-suite hotel, the place was great. It's not the fanciest, but it was beautifully decorated for Christmas with lights on the palm trees and it was very enjoyable. The hotel is just across the street from Smather's Beach and is only a short walk, shuttle ride or bike trip away from Duval street. The rooms are large and spacious with lots of storage space and are clean with comfortable beds and also have a big bathroom. The vanity is very nice and the room is spacious enough to kick back in but also close to one of the few beaches in Key West. In the restaurant, the staff was very good. If at all possible the staff tried to accommodate late checkouts for all who requested it. Fantastic service. Although the restaurant closed at 9 and the bar also closed too early for the crowd, at 11. The food and staff was great. The hotel's elevators are not recommended to be used. Parking in the Duval Street area is pricey but the hotel has plenty of bicycles that are available to rent too.",0.41030374

This location is great if you're looking to access the great fun and action close-by, but with that comes hustle-and-bustle noise from the street the hotel is located on. The rustic rooms here are a little small but really comfortable and clean while the beds are big. There was a thatched roof to the room that provided an airy feel but of course not soundproof. The hotel provides great breakfast to be eaten above the garden or to take away. The hotel does not provide private parking unfortunately.","Playa del Karma is perfect for ambiance. It has charm, serenity, and is relaxing and pleasant. It is simply lovely and beautiful. The hotel is in close proximity to 5th Avenue Playa Del Carmen.

The hotel is situated in close proximity to the Colosseum ( around seven minutes away) and around fifteen minutes walk to the Trevi Fountain. There are a lot of restaurants close by. The hotel is also in a good location to take advantage of the tram system. The room itself is of a good size with decent decoration but the shower cubicle and the bed are both on the small size. Most of the staff do speak English and therefore were able to explain all of the functions of the hotel. The food served here is really good and tasty.

As well as being really helpful the staff at this hotel were super friendly and nice. The units facing the lake had large covered patios to enjoy your coffee on. There is only one complaint and that is the people in the room above were up all night long, but that is the only downside to this hotel.","The hotel had an antiquated, rustic look and would definitely stay there again. The location is superb because it's right on the lake. It's a bit of a drive away if someone wants to go downtown but the roads are decent around this location. The 2 bed condos are big and offer a relaxing experience away from the Strip but some of the beds squeak. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful.

There's mainstream shopping and the theatre quarters close-by though which adds to how good the location is. The shower in the room was very modern. Most of the staff were friendly to guests. This hotel has a small restaurant that provides superb food that very proudly uses local and organic produce.

The hotel is ideally situated for socialising in Queen St West, as well as the theatre district and shopping areas. The hotel has great music and food available.

Aside from the unfriendly reception staff most of the hotel staff were very nice.

The location is absolutely perfect because there are fine-dining options nearby as well as great shopping. Additionally there are good transportation links if you would prefer. The room was large and featured a great shower in the slightly smaller bathroom. There were great amenities here such as a refrigerator, stove, coffee pot, and others in the small kitchen attached. The staff make sure you have everything and go out of their way to be helpful, treating you like royalty every step of the way. They're really nice.

They do enforce valet parking however which is a little offputting. Dinner at this hotel was really good and pleasing. There are also other food options nearby such as a restaurant that serves Italian food. There was a small outdoor patio which unfortunately overlooked the pool and other patios and that made it quite noisy. There are valet and parking services available too.","Staying at the hotel is generally a good experience, but it can be noisy and its cleanliness needs improving. The hotel is situated close to the beach and is on the far side of Waikiki so it is a little quieter than the centre . After receiving an upgrade when the first room was unacceptable the King sized room was okay but nothing special. The room was clean, at least.

The only issue was the shower in the bathroom, which would spray outside the stall. The service was outstanding in general; the staff here at this hotel are both helpful as well as professional. But there were some small teething problems , for example the housekeeping staff don't work after midnight. The hotel offered really chocolates and gingersnaps in the lobby and free breakfast. Lovely pool area. The valet parking should be provided.","Hotel le Marais is a new, clean, modern boutique hotel. With a courtyard and pool, it feels very upscale but is cozy and non-pretentious.

Key landmarks and local galleries are within walking distance. This hotel can boast of having heavenly beds and clean rooms but the shower sprayed outside of the shower stall and caused puddles on the floor.

The hotel staff pleasantly provided lots of great local recommendations. The food here is okay including the hot and cold options for breakfast buffet. It is worth checking restaurants across the road as well.
