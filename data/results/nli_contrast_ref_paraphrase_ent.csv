This hotel is ideal for those who want to get away from the hustle and bustle of life; it lies in close proximity to the beach and is set up perfectly for peace and quiet. Its suites boast modern decor, ample storage space, comfortable beds and large bathrooms with nice vanity areas. Not only that, the staff are accommodating and willing to help with last minute late checkout requests. The food in the restaurant is top-notch but unfortunately shuts down early. The hotel even has bikes available to rent, however, finding parking nearby may be costly. Lastly, the elevators leave much to be desired in terms of safety. Esthetically during the holidays, this all-suite hotel was decorated to perfection with Christmas lights and palm trees.","

This hotel was somewhat pricey and its cleaning standards were just passable. Unfortunately, it's not in a great spot because it's away from the old town - home to some of the better attractions. On the plus side, however, it's away from the hustle and bustle. The staff was not particularly friendly or helpful. Breakfast can be had at the outdoor restaurant, which can be quite nice, and if you are a Florida resident you may be able to get a discounted rate. The pool and hot tub are worth checking out.

The hotel has a pleasant atmosphere and is reasonably priced, making it an ideal option if you're looking to get to the many activities and attractions located nearby. However, the street on which the building is situated can be quite noisy. The quaint rooms are cozy and tidy, but slightly limited in size, plus the beds are roomy. The room also has an open atmosphere thanks to its thatched roof, though this means that sound insulation is not present. Breakfast is available to eat in the garden or takeaway, however, the hotel does not have a parking facility.","

The Yucatan province is made even more special because of the hotel's presence in the area and its clear difference from the commercial ones like Cancun. Highly appraised food is served here and thereby becomes worth the repeated visits. The location is well-suited for those who prefer to shop and grab a bite nearby. Though the rooms in the hotel come with only basic amenities, their showers are in good functioning. As a nice touch, their towels are formed into animals shapes. Apart from the two well-sized pools, there are also some ping-pong tables. However, the internet connectivity is a bit of a let-down.","

In conclusion, the accommodation was satisfactory and this unique establishment has my endorsement. It is conveniently located for sight-seeing trips to the city as well as for tranquil strolls and jogs along the waterfront in the vicinity.
