The Conrad Istanbul is an excellent hotel for business or pleasure and a breath of fresh air when it comes to hospitality industry pricing.

The staff at the hotel were efficient and welcoming. Breakfast was plentiful but busy at peak times. The gym facilities were great and wifi worked fine. The only downside to the hotel is that you have to pay for dialup service for internet. And construction noise.
