This hotel by the Central Station in Amsterdam is a great choice for a good rate. While the rooms may be a bit on the smaller side, they provide great value.

This hotel does justice to the favorable comments people have made about it, and guests have great visibility of the Grand Canal. Tourist spots are easily accessed via a short stroll, or one can sit on the veranda and catch a glimpse of life in Venice. The sleeping and living areas are adequately lit and pristine. The lavatories, while small, serve the purpose. The hotel employees are top-notch and will be more than glad to offer directions, sightseeing information and restaurant suggestions. The hotel is secluded, since it stands opposite the Santa Lucia Train Station, and the only item to cross to reach the accommodation is one's luggage.",The personnel were extremely friendly and oblig,b,comm,38,0.8487329483032227,0.006696265656501055,0.14457076787948608,NEUTRAL,gen

This hotel provides an ideal place to stay for day, located near the Raffles Centre and the MRT station, with convenient access to Burger King and a 7-Eleven shop, where one can buy inexpensive bottled water. The hotel is well kept, although its rooms seem a bit outdated. The air conditioning works great, yet the power cable wasn't attached. Furthermore, the staff was pleasant and gave helpful tips about places to eat. The only condition to be careful of at this hotel is the high marble strip placed between the main room and the bathroom, which could cause pain in one's toes if not handled cautiously.","

The Swissotel Sydney On Market Street is a cozy hotel with a pleasant aura. It is conveniently located to a great variety of sights, including the town hall rail station and the town hall station, which are both within a short jaunt. The rooms in the hotel are comfortable and tidy, though the bathrooms are quite petite with a miniscule shower. Unfortunately, the food provided by the hotel was quite limited and the rates were more than what was stated on their website.","

This hotel was a great find in a beautiful atmosphere. Not too far from the metro and within walking distance of the downtown area of Paris, we were able to enjoy the experience of the city without breaking our budget. We had a lovely view from the room of the canal leading up to the rotunda. Just a five-minute trip from the metro station, it's a convenient transportation option. The staff were incredibly friendly, not even offering an apology afterwards. Breakfast provided enough to feed us adequately, with hot menu options. The only drawback was that one of the lifts was closed, but this wasn't a significant issue to us.","
