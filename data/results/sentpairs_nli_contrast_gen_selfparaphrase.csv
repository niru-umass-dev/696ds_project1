My pal suggested the Holiday Inn San Giovanni, located close to public transit though not right in downtown Rome. It is a mere 10-minute walk to get to the city center.

This hotel was stunning and a fantastic choice for discovering the main attractions in Rome. Piazza Navona was an ideal spot, making it a breeze to get around and explore. The accommodations, albeit not vast, were comfortable, and the bathrooms were immaculate. The Richard Meier rooms had adjustable beds and made wise use of the limited space in each room.
