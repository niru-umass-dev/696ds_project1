"This is a great condo that was comfortable, convenient, and much nicer than staying in a hotel. It would be a shame not to come back again. The location of the hotel is perfectly situated on the lake and there is the option to rent boats down at Indian Point if needed. Fantastic views. As well as being really helpful the staff at this hotel were super friendly and nice. The units facing the lake had large covered patios to enjoy your coffee on. There is only one complaint and that is the people in the room above were up all night long, but that is the only downside to this hotel.","This is a great condo that was comfortable, convenient, and much nicer than staying in a hotel.",a,comm,4,0.9863615036010742,0.005130701698362827,0.008507789112627506,NEUTRAL,ref

This greatly loved hotel is well kept and comfortable. Everything you could need in terms of shops and restaurants are really close to this hotel making it superbly located. Additionally there are plenty of attractions such as a theatre and cathedral just around the corner. The view from the luxurious room was really nice overlooking the courtyard when it was sunny. Additionally rooms can accommodate four people while still being comfortable and really clean. The doorman was always at the entrance of the hotel to greet guests and the great staff were very welcoming. There was a buffet for breakfast and it provided great-tasting food. Additionally there is a great outdoor dining area that was well-suited for eating lunch. There were some really great toiletries available at this hotel.
