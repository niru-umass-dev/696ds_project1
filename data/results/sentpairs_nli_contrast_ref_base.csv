"This is a great condo that was comfortable, convenient, and much nicer than staying in a hotel. It would be a shame not to come back again. The location of the hotel is perfectly situated on the lake and there is the option to rent boats down at Indian Point if needed. Fantastic views. As well as being really helpful the staff at this hotel were super friendly and nice. The units facing the lake had large covered patios to enjoy your coffee on. There is only one complaint and that is the people in the room above were up all night long, but that is the only downside to this hotel.",The hotel was very comfortable to stay at.,a,comm,4,0.9621042609214783,0.0023026156704872847,0.03559305518865585,NEUTRAL,ref

"This is a decent place to stay and will leave you feeling happy overall. Initially there was a bit of a rough start here at the hotel but still a nice hotel. There is some peace and quiet here at this hotel but it is still quite close to the action with restaurants and shopping nearby. The room was clean with adequate disabled access , but it may take a while to get access to the room. The staff here are okay and mostly very helpful. They do enforce valet parking however which is a little offputting. Dinner at this hotel was really good and pleasing. There are also other food options nearby such as a restaurant that serves Italian food. There was a small outdoor patio which unfortunately overlooked the pool and other patios and that made it quite noisy. There are valet and parking services available too.",Great location near the beach.,a,comm,9,0.8673054575920105,0.10778525471687317,0.024909285828471184,NEUTRAL,ref

The hotel is located in the centre of Lincoln Park with restaurants and a good night life. The hotel itself is located on Clark Street which is a shoppers' delight. The hotel has double beds in the single rooms which is great for one or two people.

"The resort will have you wanting to keep coming back because it is really relaxing and welcoming. The hotel was a short taxi ride away from the town centre. It was quite a drive to Duval Street and this was rather expensive in a taxi. The room was beautiful and has amazing views. With regards to the bed in the room it had great quilted bedding. You could not wish for better staff service here because it is five-star. They were really helpful as well as friendly and welcoming. There are some great salt pools where you can sip some cocktails and achieve some peace and tranquillity. The price is quite steep however there are four amazing pools and an outdoor bar, so would definitely come back again.",This hotel is really enjoyable and definitely recommended.,b,comm,37,0.21548610925674438,0.0013131080195307732,0.783200740814209,ENTAILMENT,ref
