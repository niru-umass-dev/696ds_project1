This hotel was somewhat pricey and its cleaning standards were just passable. Unfortunately, it's not in a great spot because it's away from the old town - home to some of the better attractions.

If you want a top-notch spotless hotel, this is the one for you. It offers a nice, unforgettable experience. Its location is better than most, with a stunning view of the Colosseum, reachable in less than ten minutes by foot. The rooms are well decorated, though some may think the beds are undersized. The staff on duty speak English and the hotel provides a continental buffet breakfast with delicious cappuccino served on the rooftop terrace. The shower in the on-site bathrooms, however, are slightly diminutive.","

The stay at the hotel was pleasant and it was as if one were in their own home. Highly suggested.

This stay was mostly positive with its beautiful scenery and high-end spa facilities generating a pleasant atmosphere. The guestroom was excessive in noise and lacked a mini-fridge, but the pull-out couch proved to be of excellent quality, resulting in a good amount of rest. Nearly all of the staff members were exceptional in providing a memorable service - the only exception being the doormen and the person at the reception desk who could be somewhat impolite. Although the food was costly, the eatery had commendable dishes. Also, the hotel had a cinematic with films geared towards children.

Some people suggest this hotel to others, while others may not. It is conveniently located near St. Charles line as well as being within walking distance of the Garden District and a short distance away from the French Quarter. The hotel rooms boast kitchen facilities and are in immaculate condition despite having small bathrooms. However, the shower was top-notch. Additionally, the staff were particularly courteous, especially the welcoming porters. Moreover, the hotel is surrounded by incredible culinary spots. There is a security feature allowing access to the building with the use of a wristband.","

This hotel is an adequate place to stay and can leave one very content in the end. There were a few setbacks in the beginning, however it is still an attractive hotel.

The staff are alright and most are willing to help which is fortunate, however they do deal with valet parking which can be a bit repulsive.

This hotel offers all the latest amenities but its interior design is in an attractive vintage style. Visitors can get to the city centre easily and quickly, rendering it incredibly desirable for its location. A few of the rooms are tastefully decorated and tranquil, with comfortable beds and a fireplace. Although the water pressure for showers was impressive, walls are thin and soundproofing is lacking due to the building's age. The hotel also provides a car service and serves delicious food. However, the faucets in the sinks require a bit more force to use.","

This tremendous spot is ideal for either business or pleasure. Journeys spent here have always been pleasant and hassle-free. It's right by the theatre district with eateries nearby and situated close to Macy's, TJ Maxx and other local shops, plus the closest metro stop for travel convenience.

The hotel is quite and sanitary, making it a pleasant place to stay when in Rome. It is in proximity to dining spots and the center of the city.

The passageways may need some decor to liven it up. The complimentary Wi-Fi was in great condition and the Bulgari toiletries smelled heavenly.","

This place is great for a brief stay, so you likely won't want to leave! Although it is not located particularly close to the city centre, the area is secure, so its location is fairly good. The rooms in the hotel are contemporary, plus you can get a free cup of coffee from the barista. There is a coffee maker also available. You do have to pay 12 pounds per night for parking. It is noteworthy to mention that one of the receptionists appeared unhelpful when an occurrence happened at the hotel.","

This attractive and attractive hotel tends to be quite occupied in September. Situated in a peaceful area, it is also proximate to the many noteworthy activities in Venice. Although the accommodations are tidy, they are more like a dormitory, with an up-charge of 20 Euros for a better space. Fortunately, the landlady and landlord are exceptionally amiable, and even though the breakfast is plain, the breakfast area is small and gets quickly crowded, but there are multiple eateries nearby. Exploring Murano by boat is definitely worth it, the suggestion is to go on the usual boat trip.","

This hotel is an impressive example of a 'Las Vegas style' building that is connected to a shopping centre and convention centre.

The club room was a treat but it can get quite loud due to the traffic, yet the decor was updated and the room spacious. The large bathroom gave an additional comfort. The competent staff was helpful and check-in/check-out was an easy and convenient process. The food served is good but a bit expensive.

The room wasn't incredibly special, being quite diminutive and ordinary, however there was a large mattress and some pleasant toiletries at hand. The hotel boasts a breakfast buffet and you can enjoy a beverage while looking out over the marina. The internet was unfortunately not free but the rooftop pool area was rather pleasant. Additionally, the gym, although very compact in size, boasted the essentials.","

My stay at the hotel was truly wonderful and an unforgettable experience. The location was delightful, situated on a street surrounded by trees which was popular with local people.

The bedroom was pleasant, clean and tidy with a comfortable bed. The workers at the hotel were a mix of helpful and unprofessional. It offered uncomplicated French cuisine with a backdrop of the canal, and it was noted that the hot items for breakfast ran out quite quickly.

Guests are recommended to visit the hotel, which is situated conveniently by the Grand Canal and a few stops away from San Marco Square and the Salute Church. The area nearby also offers countless art galleries and the Vaporetto. The rooms that look out onto the canal were very clean. As for food, the hotel provides a simple menu that can be enjoyed wherever you like, along with the fully stocked minibar. It came at a bit of a price yet it was definitely worth it.","

This hotel has a wonderful setting for sightseeing around the city and there are many local shops and restaurants close by. Additionally, the complex is enhanced by the vibrant orange trees in the area. The rooms are pleasing, although sound can be an issue due to doors being opened and shut. Furthermore, the breakfast is good with fairly tasty options including recommended scrambled eggs. It is worth considering bringing earplugs if you are a light sleeper as the bells from the local church may be disruptive. Despite this, it could be argued that the hotel lacks some personal touches and may be overrated.","
