This hotel was somewhat pricey and its cleaning standards were just passable. Unfortunately, it's not in a great spot because it's away from the old town - home to some of the better attractions. On the plus side, however, it's away from the hustle and bustle. The staff was not particularly friendly or helpful. Breakfast can be had at the outdoor restaurant, which can be quite nice, and if you are a Florida resident you may be able to get a discounted rate. The pool and hot tub are worth checking out.

This hotel is an adequate place to stay and can leave one very content in the end. There were a few setbacks in the beginning, however it is still an attractive hotel. You can have some serenity here, but still stay close to the main attractions of restaurants and shopping. The rooms were tidy and set up for those with disabilities, but could be problematic in terms of immediate access. The staff are alright and most are willing to help which is fortunate, however they do deal with valet parking which can be a bit repulsive. Dinner at the hotel was marvelous, and there are many other places near by that offer alternatives especially Italian cuisine. There is a nice patio, unfortunately it is near the pool and other patios which can be quite noisy. Additionally, the hotel does provide valet and parking services.","There is a nice patio, unfortunately it is near the pool and other patios which can be quite noisy.",a,comm,9,0.1046706959605217,0.14392510056495667,0.7514042854309082,ENTAILMENT,ref

The feeling of being in this place was generally great and true to the city; a really nice spot with a lot of effort put into it. Some of the rooms have no windows and the furniture is in poor condition. The cleanliness of the guest rooms definitely needs improving. Management didn't appear to be too enthusiastic, however the concierge and reception staff were helpful and friendly throughout their shift despite being occupied. For breakfast only coffee and pastries are available. Despite the affordable price and complimentary parking, they alone were not justifications to make this selection.","

This hotel is significantly older than the images on their site suggest. On the whole, it is an acceptable establishment; situated conveniently near the train station, major features of Florence, buses to Fiosole, the plaza Michelangelo, and the discount mall. However, the rooms are diminutive and can make one feel insecure. Plus, traffic to and from the adjacent construction zone can be audible. The staff members do not seem particularly cordial either. It is also quite loud.","

This hotel provides a combination of comfort and an oddly-unsettling feeling. It is situated in a convenient area, just steps away from Eaton Centre, Yonge Street, and leading shopping venues. Unfortunately, the blocks around it are not great. The staff was incredibly friendly and gave helpful tips for local attractions. The food was satisfactory with both hot and cold dishes included in the breakfast buffet; there are other restaurants near the hotel worth exploring as well. The establishment offers a number of great extras like a pool with hot tubs and a well-equipped locker room area, a spacious rooftop terrace with plenty of seating, and complimentary Wi-Fi. The only con is the costly parking setup.",The only con is the costly parking setup.,a,comm,15,0.8153713345527649,0.18199977278709412,0.002628820948302746,NEUTRAL,ref

This excellent hotel is an ideal option for those travelling to Chicago, since it is very conveniently located, just off the river and a short walk from downtown. The rooms had ample space but unfortunately were a bit dusty and too hot, and the beds and bathrooms were satisfactory. Unfortunately, some of the cleaning staff failed to clean one area. Additionally, items from the minibar, even something as simple as a canned soft drink, were too high of a price. Further, the parking system is overly expensive valet.

This tremendous spot is ideal for either business or pleasure. Journeys spent here have always been pleasant and hassle-free. It's right by the theatre district with eateries nearby and situated close to Macy's, TJ Maxx and other local shops, plus the closest metro stop for travel convenience. The hotel's rooms are incredibly well-kept and come highly recommended. There's only one dining establishment and a small bar in the hotel so your choices are limited. Complimentary breakfast is available although not advertised prominently, however, a fee is charged for accessing the WiFi and the fitness centre isn't exactly the best.","

This hotel is one of the most comfortable and enjoyable stays due to its great facilities. Unfortunately, its location is not ideal as it is not in the most picturesque area of Hong Kong. The accommodation is decent, though a bit too darkly lit, but it is clean and tranquil. For a more modern room, it is recommended to reserve a room on the club floor.

This is an ideal place to stay for a brief period and is incredibly good value. If you're wanting to go to certain nearby attractions, such as the Musee d'Orsay or Saint Germain, then the hotel's location is right up your alley.

The staff are very helpful and pleasant, and breakfast is stocked with an abundance of fresh, natural groceries. Furthermore, guests can avoid long lines at certain sights with the ticket that comes with the hotel.","

Booking directly with the hotel provided a truly remarkable experience that surely made for a memorable weekend. Located near a metro station, it was convenient to explore the eateries of Old Montreal, while also being within walking distance of the Montreal Jazz Festival. Each room was of acceptable size and featured spotless decor with sophisticated furnishings, as well as containing some historic artifacts from its former existence as a bank. WiFi was provided for free, and the delightful modern artwork really stood out. Additionally, the bar was great for unwinding with some live music, and there was no external noise from the street. Plus, on Friday and Saturday nights, an entertaining music group could be heard in the bar area.","Plus, on Friday and Saturday nights, an entertaining music group could be heard in the bar area.",a,comm,44,0.45989441871643066,0.005342049058526754,0.5347635746002197,ENTAILMENT,ref
