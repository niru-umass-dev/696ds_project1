It was such a delight to stay in this condo, with it being much more preferable than that of a hotel. Experiencing the tranquility of the lake, alongside the ability to hire boats from Indian Point, made it all the more worthwhile. The views were remarkable, and there was nothing the hotel staff could do more to make everyone more comfortable. Even the balconies set overlooking the lake are perfect for a relaxing cup of coffee.

This hotel offers a luxurious experience but some may find it uneasy due to its location. Being just steps away from the Eaton Centre, Yonge Street, and other various shopping areas, it has convenient placement. Sadly, the blocks surrounding the hotel may not be up to par. However, the friendly staff were more than willing to provide travelers with local tips and recommendations. As far as food goes, the hot and cold options served at the breakfast buffet are okay but it may be worth looking into what restaurants across the street have to offer. The hotel also has several great amenities making it a desirable place to stay such as its swimming pool with hot tubs and locker room facilities, a stunning roof top seating area, and Wi-Fi access",This hotel gives a mix of luxury and odd unsafe feeling.,b,a,15,0.9750755429267883,0.022624023258686066,0.002300422405824065,NEUTRAL,ref

"This hotel gives a mix of luxury and odd unsafe feeling. The location was fine. It is on the outskirts of downtown and close to everything you need: it is steps away from Eaton Centre, Yonge Street, and great shopping areas. However, the blocks surrounding it aren't ideal.
