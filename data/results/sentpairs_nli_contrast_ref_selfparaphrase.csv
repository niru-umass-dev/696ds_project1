It was such a delight to stay in this condo, with it being much more preferable than that of a hotel. Experiencing the tranquility of the lake, alongside the ability to hire boats from Indian Point, made it all the more worthwhile. The views were remarkable, and there was nothing the hotel staff could do more to make everyone more comfortable. Even the balconies set overlooking the lake are perfect for a relaxing cup of coffee. The only downside, unfortunately, was the people in the upper floor who kept everyone up all night with their noise levels, however, this did not combat the wonderful time at this condo.","

People have different feelings about this hotel, but it is located near buses on St. Charles Avenue and also close to the Garden District but not too far from the French Quarter.

This hotel is located adjacent to some of the city's most iconic spots, like the Dam Square and Anne Franks House and is set along a tranquil canal. Unfortunately, the room itself was diminutive, however, it featured a captivating view of the canal. We suggest reserving a bigger room as the one we stayed in had a surprisingly large bathroom. Furthermore, the reception and breakfast personnel were far from friendly and their hospitality was dreadful. Additionally, considering the cost, the breakfast options were poor quality and limited.","Despite its low cost, the breakfast selection was sparse and the food not up to very much.",b,comm,10,0.859813392162323,0.09647725522518158,0.04370932653546333,NEUTRAL,ref

It is in just the right location and a short walk to all the main attractions. The rooms are spotless and the mattress is incredibly comfortable. The only issue was the shower, which had some leakage outside the cubicle. The service was generally excellent; the staff here are both accommodating and professional. There were a few minor hiccups, such as the cleaning staff not functioning after 12am. Additionally, the hotel had wonderful chocolates and germsnaps in the lobby and free breakfast.

This hotel is a great option for the younger and more spirited crowd, such as a girl's trip. It is conveniently located near bus stops into the city centre and offers views and proximity to a number of restaurants and activities in Lincoln Park. Clark Street, which is within walking distance of the hotel, is also a consumer's paradise. The single bedrooms come with two beds, making them suitable for one or two people, and the cleanliness of the rooms, apart from some drain problems in the showers, was top notch. There are also two important amenities for guests at this hotel- a hearty breakfast, and reliable security which requires the use of a key card to enter into certain elevators and stairwells. Plus, the WiFi is free! The only thing worth noting is the limited parking availability, as well as some street noise, but it's minor enough to be barely noticeable.","The hotel has good security, as your key card is needed to gain access to elevators or stairwells.",b,a,13,0.01882253587245941,0.006270990706980228,0.9749064445495605,ENTAILMENT,ref

This hotel is an absolute must-visit. Only a stone's throw away from the beach, the Port Olympic and Barcelonetta, this five-star establishment is sure to make you want to come back again. Boasting a stunning rooftop pool with a view of the sea, a fitness park two minutes away and a top-notch Jacuzzi on the rooftop, its features add to the overall star-rated experience. While the room had an excellent bathroom, its pillows and linen were a bit uncomfortable. The bed was great and there was plenty of space in the room and it was clean, with a sea view to top it off.
