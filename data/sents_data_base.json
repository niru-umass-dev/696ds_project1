As people in our group trickled into the restaurant , we kept adding to tables, asked for separate checks etc and it was never a problem. Many of us asked for a late checkout last minute and they accomodated as many as possible. Pool was heated and lovely, a hot tub in the corner.

Dirty, unsafe, only thing really redone was the lobby!!

We had a magical weekend staying here and every went on without a hitch, good laid back service at a very reasonable price. This is the place to stay in Key West. Since we brought our bikes, we did not have to move our car at all in the 3 days we were there, Duval street is just a short ride from the hotel.... don't own a bike?

Rooms are small, with uncomfortable beds, dirty rug, and worn-out furniture. The only places that look better than other motels are the lobby and pool. However, nobody sleeps in the lobby... The pool area was crowded, with many smokers wandering around, giving second-hand smoke to children cheerfully playing. I booked a room with two queen beds, but they gave me one with a king bed. Talking to the hotel staff and customer rep of Hotels.com proved to be wasting of time -- almost an hour to be exact. Did I mention that the hotle is inconveniently located outside of the old town where the attractions are? I'll never stay here again!", "It was a very comfortable and fun place to be at the end of an active day/evening in town. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We especially enjoyed the outside restaurant at breakfast and thought the lavish poolside landscaping was beautiful. Also enjoyed the live entertainment at the tiki bar. This was our second visit to Key West and we much preferred staying at The Inn at Key West instead of staying in town.", "We stayed two nights at this overpriced hotel! It looks just like a dirty motel with filthy rugs and roaches! The staff was rude and not very helpful! You can stay at lovely B&B in old town that is actually cheaper than this dump!

Then today..still good service from Angela the bartender but ??? bar full of local kids/angela's friends?,drinking heavily, dropping the F bomb every couple of minutes and getting loud and obnoxiousthey took up whole side of bar and most of Angela's time and sounded like they frequent the pool often so my question to the mangaement is the bar and pool for the use of your guests or the local kids. Big mistake we are the ones that pay for the rooms maybe you want to reconsider the use of the pool/ bar as for guest use. So far this is the only glitch in a wonderful stay with courteous staff hopefully and anamoly. I would still highly recommend this Inn and its serene setting if some rules too the bartenders are made no drunken friends monopolizing the bar one incident doesn't warrant a bad report.", "Everything about this place is top-notch. The lobby is beautiful - the staff is cheerful, friendly and helpful. They make changes and solve problems with a great attitude. The rooms are clean, well-furnished and comfortable.

We were there to get engaged and as I had mentioned that to Angelo, within ten minutes of getting into our room a bottle of champagne was delivered up to us. The staff are absolutely lovely and I will recommend this hotel to anyone I know travelling to Rome. We hated to leave. To all of the staff in Hotel Raffaello, thank you for your kindness.", "Because of a mistake on my part, I had to cancel the day of our arrival at the last minute. After explaining my problem they took car of the change without charges. We cannot rave enough about the service from the front desk staff and the wonderful treatment by the two women in the breakfast room. The rooms were roomy and beyond clean. We think this is a hidden gem in Rome. Joe & Bev Wood Macungie PA", "Excellent location if you want to consider somewhere close enough to the main train terminus to walk to/back, and near the main tube line as well as the historic sites. The room was very pleasant no noise, and breakfast was simple but substantive. The hotel is also near to the large supermarket which may be used to make lunch to help reduce costs on the long days walks ahead. Great centre overall to base your visit", "We found the Raffaello hotel to meet all our needs. The room was very comfortable and even enjoyed the jacuzzi shower once we worked out how to use it! The location is excellent, 5 mins away from the Termini and the Colosseum and an easy walk to all other tourist locations. Especially enjoyed the breakfast which offered an assortment of pastries, cold meats, bread, scrambled eggs, fruit and cake. Yum Yum! Amazing cappuccino's!", "Great location. Friendly. Good deal.", "We stayed at the Raffaello for three nights. The hotel is in a safe area and within walking distance to the Colosseum and the Termini. The rooms were very clean but the shower was incredibly small. If you are over 6 foot you probably won't fit. Personnel at the desk were very friendly and helpful with all our questions, directions, and requests for taxi service. Breakfast was excellent, the best we had during our 12 day travels throughout Italy, and included scrambled eggs daily. One day, however, a lady had her purse stolen while at the breakfast buffet. Someone must have come in from the outside, blended in with the crowd, and made off with the purse. If I return to Italy I would try to stay nearer the Campo de Fiori area for the night life and restaurants."]}, {"split": "train", "entity_a": "1413478", "entity_a_name": "Village At Indian Point", "entity_b": "90767", "entity_b_name": "Chateau on the Lake Resort & Spa", "entity_a_uid": ["UR131506667", "UR68869649", "UR115231925", "UR115052324", "UR136434463", "UR84624204", "UR80857479", "UR79445477"], "entity_b_uid": ["UR15736424", "UR115536587", "UR131858460", "UR127373620", "UR38582604", "UR126712146", "UR71518663", "UR116586078"], "refs_a": [["This is a great condo that was comfortable, convenient, and much nicer than staying in a hotel.", "It would be a shame not to come back again.", "The location of the hotel is perfectly situated on the lake and there is the option to rent boats down at Indian Point if needed.", "Fantastic views.", "As well as being really helpful the staff at this hotel were super friendly and nice.", "The units facing the lake had large covered patios to enjoy your coffee on.", "There is only one complaint and that is the people in the room above were up all night long, but that is the only downside to this hotel."]], "refs_b": [["This was an okay stay here with some really lovely scenery around the place.", "The spa facilities at the hotel were top-class so it made for a lovely atmosphere.", "The room was quite noisy and didn't even have a mini-fridge inside.", "The pull-out couch was actually really good quality and sleep was great on it.", "Most of the staff were great here and provided such a memorable service.", "The only let-down was the doormen and front-desk lady were sometimes rude but overall the staff were great.", "The food was a bit expensive but the cafe restaurant definitely has unbeatable food.", "The hotel had a movie theatre that even played kids movies.", "There was a lovely lake and an indoor atrium."]], "refs_comm": [["The hotel was very comfortable to stay at."]], "source_reviews_a": ["Great location and beautiful area and scenery, Very quiet, peaceful and relaxing atmosphere!

Other than that, everything was GREAT!! See you next year! The Elder Family", "Since I found this place 5 years ago, whenever I go to Branson, this is where we choose. It's away from the Branson chaos, beautiful quiet location and we always choose the lakeview condos. We don't have a boat so the marina down at Indian Point it perfectly located if we get in the mood to rent something. We're opposite the Silver Dollar City traffic if we want to go into town during the day and we're less than a mile away if we want to go to the park. It may be a bit of a drive if someone is intensely interested in going downtown or on the Strip a lot but the roads are good and it's not that big a deal for me! We always stay in the 2-bedroom condos, it's such a relaxing, roomy place to stay, so much better for us than staying on the Strip.", "We celebrated my husband's birthday with a trip to Branson and a stay at The Village.

We have our meals on the deck and love to sit out and relax and listen to the sounds of nature, read and listen to our \"tunes.\" Just one minor detail. We couldn't find the coffee.

Nice people, nice scenery. it was to die for. I most definitely will be back here again!! the food was expensive. but i expected that. pull is 24hours. they also had a movie theater. mainly showed kids movies but they still had one.", "First time to Branson, stayed at Chateau on the Lake. It's about 10 minutes past the main strip of Branson activities but it's worth the drive for the gorgeous views and lovely relaxing hotel. For the price and service level of the hotel, I did expect to have a mini fridge (empty or stocked) but our room type (king lakeview) did not have one. We took advantage of the great weather and hotel bar and had a glass of wine out on the deck. So lovely!", "We went for our one year anniversary and had a fabulous time! The resort was stunning and the spa was lovely as well!", "Stayed last weekend and was disappointed over some details. Room 413 was very noisy...too close to heating/AC units. Also room was right above delivery area which contributed to the noise. Overall not a very welcoming feeling at the Chateau. Coffee pot would not work and when I called to request another the woman at the front desk was rude and didn't seem to believe me.

From the description of the room we rented I thought it would be tight quarters. I was pleasantly surprised to find the atmosphere and facilities to be excellent. We stayed in a small suite, bedroom and a pull out couch. We had plenty of room and were very comfortable. The pull out couch was of excellent quality and slept better than some beds I have expereinced during travels. We stayed during the John Hagee ministeries event. The Chateau staff did an excellent job handling the large crowd staying at the hotel and those that came in for the sessions.

A list of good food options in the area would have the 'Richtree market restaurant' at the top (it's also one of the closest), nice 'takesushi' place around the corner, Baton Rouge closer to Dundas square. The hotel itself is clean and comfortable. You don't choose hotel victoria because you want luxury, nice thick walls that block out most noise, or a view of anything but a brick wall (in our room anyway), but like i said it has friendly staff, is reasonably priced and is in a great location.", "I stayed over thr weekend and was VERY impressed with the quality of service(friendly staff) and the great room (really clean).

We moved to this hotel after having a bad experience at the Cosmpolitan, which is right across the street. We did not have any problems or costs involved with getting our car in and out, and another cool benefit is that the concierge staff has a fleet of vintage cars (Bentley, '60 Cadillac, Rolls) with drivers who will take you to various downtown sites for free (with an advance reservation).", "I spent quite a bit of time researching hotels in central Toronto and settled on 1 king west. My spouse and I stayed in a superior studio suite and were extremely satisfied with our stay. I was attracted initially to the non-cookie cutter rooms typical in most hotels. The room was very modern with sophisticated looking furnishings, a very comfortable bed, nice walk-in shower and modern kitchenette. We were stationed on the 18th floor and did find the room a bit dark as our bedroom window was frosted over as it clearly faced another building in close proximity. We did not consider this an issue however because the room had so many other positives and the 'office' section of the room offered a view of the lake.

It is in a great location. Walking distance to Eaton Centre, restaurants and theatres. Parking price is a little steep at 30$ a day but will pay around that amount anywhere in T.O.

Only negative in the room was the shower which tended to leak all over the bathroom floor and was so powerful it was an extremely uncomfortable experience.

A nice clean hotel in a great location for site seeing. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a short break to take in Torontos sites. Very good.

Further, because this is an old historic hotel, the rooms were small, coupled with a small bathroom. I do believe you can upgrade to a larger room but none was available at the time I reserved. As the elevator is original to the hotel, it must be staff operated. At times we had to wait for someone to attend to this.

The Gladstone had really friendly and engaging staff. Rooms were unique and fun...no cookie cutter boxes with the same old crap. Even the elevator (circa 1900) was crazy and fun. Great food, music and decor and location are killer. Lots to do around the hotel. Try it out if you want something different!", "I was very much looking forward to staying here, but I was quite disappointed. I was in town on business for a week, and my wife and child stayed with me the first day.

St. Charles is the main parade route so that means it passes right out your door. The hotel gives you wristbands to enter the building which is good because that means randoms cant go in. We stalked out positions within a couple blocks of the hotel to watch the parade and could easily go back to the room for a break. The room is equipped with a small kitchen which was perfect to heat up our leftovers and make some small meals. Even if it wasnt Mardi Gras, it's a good base to explore New Orleans with the trolley right outside your door. It's within walking distance of prime Garden district and it's a long walk to the French Quarter...probably 30 minutes to 40 minutes.

There are nicer, fancier hotels and inns nearby, but we chose the Royal Sonesta specifically for its location. Yes, it's noisy and you can hear music and rowdy crowds until late at night, but we anticipated this too. Bourbon Street was busier for an early June Monday and Tuesday night than I would have expected, but we had fun sitting on the balcony, throwing beads at the crowds who happened to walk by.", "Great place on Bourbon Street Stayed one night at the Royal Sonesta on Bourbon Street.

Parking was also overpriced and the scratched my spouse's custom car when the valet parked it.", "Great hotel!! I have family in New Orleans so I am pretty familiar with the city...I have stayed in a good deal of places/areas of town. The Royal Sonesta, by far, offers the best location and experience.

For about 3-4 days the hot water was only luke warm, one day I went out and took off the privacy sign and by 3pm the room was not made up, had to call housekeeping and when I returned at 4pm, it still was not done, had to put in an angry second call to have the room done ASAP. Also one monring I had the privacy sign on and housekeeping still knocked on my door, lucky I was not sleeping.The location cannot be beat and service/staff is still very good.", "Very nice hotel Very nice hotel.

Bad points - its on Bourbon Street + everything else. Asked for a quiet room months ahead, we were given a room next to the elevator: noisy, lots of convention goers yelling up and down the corridor at 3 a.m. Parking is difficult - they have a garage (about $30/ day !!) but its small and spaces are tight. My wife had to go to ER whilst we were there, they didn't even know where the nearest hospital was !

Our room was very quiet, if not a little cold, however I think the Venetian's are a little more hardy when it came to the -C temperatures we experienced. January was a brilliant time to visit, St Mark's square was practically empty and we did not have to queue for anything! Breakfast was basic continental style, but the humourous attention of the waitress more than made up for this.

We had booked a king room and were taken to a cramped room with no view and one double bed. When we complained, the staff said they had no rooms available that fit our confirmed reservation. They offered to give us a comparable room at a related hotel down the street, which turned out to be off the beach and much less nice than this hotel. We returned to reception to tell them the room was unacceptable and were eventually upgraded to a king room at the Outrigger Reef with a partial ocean view. Why they didn't do this first if they didn't have a regular king room I will never know, but it made us very grumpy to wait nearly two hours to get a room after a very long flight.The room was clean, but nothing special. It had a small outdoor patio, but overlooked the pool and many other patios, which made it very loud and not at all private.We would not stay here again.", "Loved the island- The Outrigger Reef was a very nice hotel. I did not however like the enforced valet parking. I was lead to believe we had to valet, but we could have parked on the upper level on our own, and still paid the $13 per day. From what I understand, it could have been worse, some hotels charged as much as $18 per day for parking. There are so many hotels, restaurants and shopping in this small area of Wikiki, that there is no parking space, so you pay dearly for having a car. Every place we went there were also tour busses that would do the same routes, but we did it at our leisure, and stayed at each site as long as we wanted. The next trip will be to another quieter less populated island. But the Island was absolutely breathtaking, expensive but breathtaking.", "Handicap access We stayed at Outrigger Reef for 7 days in mid-May 2003 and would go back in a heart beat.

In any event, the rooms were really comfortable, though slightly on the smaller side. We were on the courtyard side of the building, and you'd never know you were steps from the mayhem on Bourbon. The complimentary breakfast was great, and the welcome drinks were a nice touch. Love the courtyard and pool -- very upscale feeling, but cozy and completely non-pretentious. One downside to this being a boutique hotel: there's no housekeeping after midnight, so we had to walk down to get the extra towels the housekeeper never left. Also we had a hard time getting the shower gels refilled, and had to call to ask for this to be done. But otherwise the service was outstanding, especially Shawn at the front desk. I will definitely stay here again and recommend this place to my friends.", "We stayed at the Hotel le Marais for four nights and loved it. This modern, boutique hotel was clean and well-maintained. The beds were heavenly! The one issue in the room was that the shower would spray outside the stall, leaving huge puddles on the floor, so we had to have the shower head practically facing the opposite wall to avoid the mess. The staff was extremely helpful, particularly Pierre, who booked several tours for us and got us $10 discounts per person per tour. The best part of the hotel is that it is in the heart of the French Quarters. This visit was all of our first times in Nola.

This is a word \"calm\" that i would use to describe the Shangri la a lot. The subtle touches like the changing of the carpet in the lift showing the day of the week, to cold water and iced face towels around the pool. Service cannot be faulted and the old world touch of kneeling to serve although a shock to someone from the west was done with such style and grace you grow to enjoy the gesture.", "All the good points have been made in previous reviews but I would like to just emphasise how good the service is here. I stayed in the Valley Wing and, though very expensive, the free afternoon tea, canapes and drinks go some way to mitigating against the high cost. The eggs benedict for breakfast was the best I've had and the Singapore Sling was far better at the Shangri La than the ready mixed mediocrity being served at Raffles. It isn't as centrally located as some hotels but taxis are pretty cheap and it's worth a few minutes in a taxi if it means you can stay at such a wonderful hotel.", "Spent 2 nights at this fabulous hotel during a recent business trip. Excellant service and staff. Rooms are large and standard of cleanlines is very high. Wifi access free throughout the hotel with great connectivity. Hotel is within walking distance of the Orchard Road shopping area, however I believe the hotel also offer a free shuttle service. Hotel has a gym and swimming pool. Buffet breakfast was great, with a huge choice and fresh products. As my departure flight was at 11pm, the hotel allowed freshing up in the health club, with towels etc provided for shower. Would definately return to this hotel for both business and pleasure.", "As a regular business traveller to Singapore I always look forward to staying at the Shangri-La. Great service, attention to detail and the ever present taxi-hailer - make it feel like coming home. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with quiet aircon and welcoming tea and fruit. Room service is of a good standard and reasonably priced. One improvement could be to remember details such as non-smoking preferences - I had to really push for the hotel to move me to a non-smoking room, which they did have available, though at a higher level. Given i was checking in at midnight, for just one night, I really was disappointed that I had to push - who else would have taken the room at that time! That said, generally no complaints and a great hotel with a few extras that you don't always find in Singapore.", "What a wonderful atmosphere and a great room for a great price. The breakfast buffet was out of this world. The room was gorgeous. Service was exceptional.", "The Valley Wing at the Shangri-La is a must! Familiar atmosphere, the absolute friendly and warm staff members knew our name from the first day. In the Lobby all Champagne (Moet Chandon) is free, you will get a glass even when you wait 3 minutes for a taxi... Service is Top-end, nothing to do better. Rooms are beautiful and large, garden and pool-site are very relaxing, so I spent most of the afternoons in the pool with our baby-daughter. If you go to the Shangri-La, book the Valley Wing! Enter the Lobby, sit down, relax and sip your Champagne...

Any flaws that the Grand may have vanish thanks to the staff and many complimentry features. Excellent free breakfast buffet, nice indoor pool and jacuzzi, two rooftop jacuzzis and sitting areas (make sure you use them on warm summer night!) and free gym.

Watery scrambled eggs, pay extra for a cappuccino, bacon that died two days ago - apart from that though, a great hotel with terrific service. A short walk to the Eaton Centre and Yonge Street. A good diner/grill/bar across the road. Despite the breakfasts, I'd stay there again.", "Liked the hotel, the rooms, the pool, the hot tub on the roof.

The service was very good, the hotel was clean, the breakfast was decent, and the rooms were just fine. The hotel is in a not great area, but I felt safe, nonetheless. A bit outside of the city center, but the hotel itself is nice and it is close to a subway station, as well as a trolley line. Don't bother renting a vehicle, you won't need it! Also, the hotel offers a shuttle to sites within the downtown district. The swimming pool is very nice, and the roof space is very nice with plenty of seating and the hot tubs were great. The staff were attentive and very gracious. I would definitely stay here again.", "We got a great deal online for a nice room with a beautiful view -- the small suite with a foldout couch was perfect for our family of four. The hotel staff was pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful, with lots of tips for getting around. The location is not excellent -- it's on the outskirts of downtown, and the neighborhood is a bit scary even for those of us from other large cities -- but the hotel provides a free shuttle, and we were able to walk to restaurants and shopping without a problem. The pool room was hot and overchlorinated but adequate to calm down the kids before dinner. All in all, a nice stay, and we'd go back.", "We stayed at the Grand hotel for 2 nights, and it was great. Our Junior Suites were clean, spacious, and very comfortable. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and accomodating. The location was excellent - steps away from the Eaton Centre and great shopping.

The room was a reasonable size as we had one at the end of a corridor and the bed was comfy. The bathrooms however, need some updating, they were tired and not in the best condition.

In fact, there are many meetings held here, and so you might find yourself surrounded by a large group of businessmen - not necessarily a bad thing -but just be aware.

Rooms are clean, beds a bit hard. Bar is OK and the patio too but mostly in the shadom in the evening. Rooms that had a sea view don't have it anymore (see previous reviews). A bit expensive for the location and the lack of view (my room had a view on a skeleton building (crisis, what crisis?) on the side of the hotel, not charming at all).

I booked a family room which is really 2 separate bedrooms next to each other behind another door for privacy which was meant to lock but didn't. My kids room smelt like someone had smoked 100 cigarettes in it and had drugs and booze on the table when we checked in. They cleaned but the smell didn't go away for all 3 days and they would not change the rooms. The pool is tiny and over crowded with hardly any beds to lie on which is quite difficult with kids in a very hot city. Well done for offering free WiFi but making people check into your Facebook page every time is very irritating.

I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus. Overall I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area or closer to Old Montreal.

It was tiny: to do some ironing on the ironing board, or to have access to the electric power points, one literally had to move the furniture around. Cupboard space was inadequate. The shower was lukewarm. The only redeeming featrure was the location: not in an attractive part of Toronto, but at least within walking distance of the CN Tower and the main railway station.

I was in Toronto for an Argos football game August 12 and stayed at the Strathcona (for the second time). I paid $83USD for a Friday night. This is cheap by downtown T.O. standards.

Thanks to the convenient location of Regal, the heavy downpour did not get us wet as the hotel is connected to the airport by an enclosed link bridge. As a regular hotel guest, we got an upgrade this time. Our suite has a family room and a bed room, large and comfortable enough for my family of three. We had the best sleep in days amd woke up the next morning refreshed.

We are not hassled or stressed with rushing to the airport to catch our flight. The hotel also had regular free shuttle service to Tung Chung (outlet mall) and several stops at downtown HK. This also saved us bus/train fares.

The MTR (Tube) is very close and efficient and Hong Kong island is about 15 minutes away.We booked one of the Club Rooms which are high up and give an excellent view of the City.

We missed not having a mini fridge, and felt that having only one chair in a deluxe room with two queen beds was a miss even though there was plenty of room for more comfortable seating. The valet staff was slow to bring our car at checkout. There were no others waiting, and no new arrivals, yet it took them 20 minutes to get our car to us.", "Stayed here in middle of June 2011. My partner was in Chicago on business and I tagged along for fun. We had both been to Chicago before. Things I really liked about the hotel: the location was amazing and the view was really nice; the bed was very comfortable; the staff was pleasant and helpful; the business center had a printer which was great for printing boarding passes. Our remote controls never really worked, and the noise level from the hallways was surprising. I found the bathroom wasn't very clean when we arrived (hairs in the bathtub, etc) and we sometimes found certain parts of our deluxe room a little unsavoury smelling. For parking, you do have in-and-out privileges, which is quite nice.", "We stayed 3 nights in this beautiful hotel and enjoyed every minute of it. Our room located on the 25th floor gave us a wonderful view of the Chicago River. This was my kids first time seeing snow fall, so the river was a nice backdrop. Two minor drawbacks: no soda vending machines and the toilet paper seemed a little cheap for such a nice hotel. Also, if you want a refrigerator make sure you request it. Not all rooms have them. The front desk clerks were warm and friendly.", "Were hoping for the best since this isn't a 'brand' name but SOOO HAPPY we tried this boutique hotel. STAFF was GREAT as well as EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS PLACE! LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! Celebrating friends 50th the LADIES had a fab time all around and such a GREAT view of the City!

View of the river was beautiful. The rooms were huge, especially compared to other Chicago hotels. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. Only negative is the wait for the 1 elevator.sometimes up to 10 minutes. As long as you plan ahead, it isn't too big of a problem. Will stay here again!", "We booked this hotel through TravelZoo, and we had a very nice stay there. Our room had a huge bath with both a shower and a separate tub - plus two separate sinks.

While I had a postcard view of the Bosphorous from my room, I could further embrace that beauty and enjoy drinks, snacks, reading material and conversation with fellow guests. The Conrad, Istanbul was a breath of fresh air when it comes to the hospitality industry. My requests were handled to my satisfactions, quickly and it was flattering to know that President Obama had also stayed at the hotel in April 2009.

It was quiet and quaint and the hotel staff was very friendly. We first got taken to a room across the bridge from the main hotel (1st floor) that seemed more like a dorm room than a hotel room.

We stayed with two other couples and all agreed that we would recommend this hotel to all our friends back in Australia.

When you arrive in Venice the vast majority of travellers will arrive at one of these two locations. Then you are set loose into the MAZE that is Venice!

We stayed at this location three nights and were able to walk comfortably to all major sights without problem. I will not rave about this hotel, but I found nothing materially wrong with it either. This is a typical 2-3 star hotel and makes up for its lack of \"grandness\" by having a fantastically helpful and friendly staff.", "We stayed two nights at this hotel. We found the staff very friendly, and helpful. Our room was clean and of a good size. If you want to experience true italian culture, then this family is for you. The breakfast was continental, and very good and ample. If you want scrambled eggs and bacon when you are in Europe, then stay home. If you want to enjoy the culture you are in then ask this facility for recommendations for restaurants, side trips, etc., they are more than accommodating. We will definately use this hotel on our next visit.", "We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay in Oceania. We had a double room that was spotless and also quite spacious. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and answered any questions we had on places to visit etc. The internet access was very useful and was free. Breakfast was lovely - breads, pastries, juices and coffee. The hotel is in an ideal location, close to all the main sites and on a nice quiet street. Would love to go back!", "I booked a 3 night stay at Hotel Oceania based on a recommendation from Rick Steves. The location is definately convienent as it is a short walk from the train station which is also thier main center for Rome's subway and bus systems. Internet was available in the lobby, but was not available in the room since the wireless was not working correctly. The room was clean and the hotel was nice but our overall experience was just ok.", "We had a wonderful experience at the Hotel Oceania. The location is excellent with public transportation, great restaurants and shopping very nearby. The rooms were quiet and clean. The staff was very gracious and helpful and the serve really delicious coffee! Rick Steves (2012) certainly didn't disappoint.", "We stayed just one night but will surely stay here when again in Rome. Large old room with great renovated bathroom. Very clean and comfortable. Staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful. Even packed us a take away breakfast because we had to leave early.", "We would stay here again. Great location, spacious rooms, good, friendly service. A bonus was classical music drifting up from the opera school on the level below."], "source_reviews_b": ["I feel the hotel is slightly overrated. The setting is fine, and there are lovely orange trees in the nice court yards of the smallish complex. However the rooms are noisy with tilen floors and banging doors. The room window gives unto the open tilen pathway leading past the doors. Breakfast is ok but basic. There is free internet available amidst the breakfast tables. Staff seems a little scarce, with the couple serving breakfast later in the day cleaning the rooms. What is missing however is the loving hand. For instance all flowers are made of plastic, even the azaleas and cyclamen outside in the garden. The personal touch somehow seems missing, and that really is a pity.", "Hotel Santa Maria is a delightful, cheery & quiet place to stay, tucked away in a small street in Trastevere, Antonio (manager) is molto simpatico - friendly and very helpful. The hotel is not a fancy place, but quite comfy enough, with a good breakfast buffet, which you can eat in the lovely courtyard full of orange trees. The colorful neighborhood is great for walking around, lots of shops & outdoor restaurants that stay open late. You can easily walk to other sites in the city, though we mostly took cabs to centro to save time.", "I found this area of Rome to be very special and the Hotel Santa Maria was more than I had expected. I enjoyed the peace and serentity with the safety gates, beautiful breakfast which could be taken either in the eating area or courtyard and a nice wine bar with appetizers. The rooms were clean and well maintained. Personnel were outstanding to work with. The Trastevere area is near all of the major attractions and yet, it is magical to stroll through a maze of fascinating medieval streets with some of the best restaurants in Rome.", "Wonderful place to stay! An intimate, cozy place-loved the orange-tree courtyard. Front desk personnel was most helpful. Cleaning/cooking staff wonderful-very clean rooms. Breakfasts very filling and tasty-the scrambled eggs and cappuccino were my favorites. Neighborhood not touristy. 15-minute walk to the Colosseum; 25 min. to St. Peter's. They arranged driver for airport pickup and dropoff. Bells of neighboring Church could be sleep-disruptive for light sleepers, but earplugs blocked the noise.", "Accomodating people who are always pleasent. Good breakfast. A block from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto but tucked away from all bustle. We walked to the center of Rome, Campo Fiore, Janiculum, all over Trastevere. Close to #8 tram with connections to airport, Tivoli and all of Rome. Private courtyard through gated drive. A good refuge for tired feet and bodies. We would go back.", "We stayed here for five nights. a great base for exploring Rome; thank heavens we took a taxi - we'd never have found it by ourselves! Right in the middle of Trastevere, ideal for restaurants etc. Nice room, pity next doors plumbing is so noisy though, otherwise very peaceful. Very nice staff - would stay here again.", "Spent 4 restful nights at a lovely oasis of calm in Trastevere. Very well looked after, nothing was too much trouble. Very convenient for all parts of Rome and Vatican. Lovely that rooms opened out into open air of courtyards.", "This was a charming, albeit somewhat pricey, refuge from the overload of Rome. The employees were wonderful and the setting very peaceful. The location was also very handy, and I would definitely stay here again."], "gen_a": "The Oceania hotel was recommended to us by Rick Steves and we couldn't have been more pleased with our stay. The hotel is in an excellent location, on a quiet side street just off the Piazza della Repubblica, close to the metro and a step-on, step-off city tour bus stop. The rooms in the hotel are spacious and clean, with a renovated bathroom. The bed was not very comfortable, but the owner of the hotel spoke English well and provided recommendations for restaurants. The internet access was not free.", "gen_b": "The hotel is a charming place to stay, tucked away in a small street in Trastevere but perfectly convenient for walking around Rome and St. Peter's.
