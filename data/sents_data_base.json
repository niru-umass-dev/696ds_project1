As people in our group trickled into the restaurant , we kept adding to tables, asked for separate checks etc and it was never a problem. Many of us asked for a late checkout last minute and they accomodated as many as possible. Pool was heated and lovely, a hot tub in the corner.

We had a magical weekend staying here and every went on without a hitch, good laid back service at a very reasonable price. This is the place to stay in Key West. Since we brought our bikes, we did not have to move our car at all in the 3 days we were there, Duval street is just a short ride from the hotel.... don't own a bike?

Rooms are small, with uncomfortable beds, dirty rug, and worn-out furniture. The only places that look better than other motels are the lobby and pool. However, nobody sleeps in the lobby... The pool area was crowded, with many smokers wandering around, giving second-hand smoke to children cheerfully playing. I booked a room with two queen beds, but they gave me one with a king bed. Talking to the hotel staff and customer rep of Hotels.com proved to be wasting of time -- almost an hour to be exact. Did I mention that the hotle is inconveniently located outside of the old town where the attractions are? I'll never stay here again!", "It was a very comfortable and fun place to be at the end of an active day/evening in town. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.

Then today..still good service from Angela the bartender but ??? bar full of local kids/angela's friends?,drinking heavily, dropping the F bomb every couple of minutes and getting loud and obnoxiousthey took up whole side of bar and most of Angela's time and sounded like they frequent the pool often so my question to the mangaement is the bar and pool for the use of your guests or the local kids. Big mistake we are the ones that pay for the rooms maybe you want to reconsider the use of the pool/ bar as for guest use. So far this is the only glitch in a wonderful stay with courteous staff hopefully and anamoly.

The lobby is beautiful - the staff is cheerful, friendly and helpful. They make changes and solve problems with a great attitude. The rooms are clean, well-furnished and comfortable.

But Angelo was fabulous and we stayed in the room with the balcony, which was a great size. We were there to get engaged and as I had mentioned that to Angelo, within ten minutes of getting into our room a bottle of champagne was delivered up to us. The staff are absolutely lovely and I will recommend this hotel to anyone I know travelling to Rome. We hated to leave. To all of the staff in Hotel Raffaello, thank you for your kindness.", "Because of a mistake on my part, I had to cancel the day of our arrival at the last minute.

Especially enjoyed the breakfast which offered an assortment of pastries, cold meats, bread, scrambled eggs, fruit and cake. Yum Yum! Amazing cappuccino's!", "Great location. Friendly. Good deal.", "We stayed at the Raffaello for three nights. The hotel is in a safe area and within walking distance to the Colosseum and the Termini. The rooms were very clean but the shower was incredibly small. If you are over 6 foot you probably won't fit. Personnel at the desk were very friendly and helpful with all our questions, directions, and requests for taxi service. Breakfast was excellent, the best we had during our 12 day travels throughout Italy, and included scrambled eggs daily. One day, however, a lady had her purse stolen while at the breakfast buffet. Someone must have come in from the outside, blended in with the crowd, and made off with the purse.

Further, because this is an old historic hotel, the rooms were small, coupled with a small bathroom. I do believe you can upgrade to a larger room but none was available at the time I reserved.

The porters, Kevin and Mr. Turner were exceptional and made us feel most welcome especially after travelling 11 hours in the car. We stayed in a studio with a king bed and full kitchen, dressing area and shower. All were very clean. We exchanged our time share and this was definitely a pleasant surprise.

This was the perfect home base for all of our explorations. We have made many many trips to New Orleans but this was our 1st time staying outside of the Quarter. It was wonderful! The staff was amazing, so very nice. The rooms were spacious and well appointed, the beds very comfortable and everything upgraded and modern. Having the streetcar stop right out front made everything so easy. Would recommend this to anyone visiting this amazing city!!", "Great hotel. My wife and I showed up at 11:30 PM for the BCS championship game. Our original hotel was oversold, and they contacted the Avenue Plaza. The staff was very nice. The room was nicely appointed, with a refrigerator, stove, and coffee pot. The bathroom was small, but everything worked; it was clean, and the bed was comfortable. We could have spent a lot more and gotten a lot less.", "We stayed here during Mardi Gras and couldnt ask for a better location. St. Charles is the main parade route so that means it passes right out your door. The hotel gives you wristbands to enter the building which is good because that means randoms cant go in. We stalked out positions within a couple blocks of the hotel to watch the parade and could easily go back to the room for a break. The room is equipped with a small kitchen which was perfect to heat up our leftovers and make some small meals. Even if it wasnt Mardi Gras, it's a good base to explore New Orleans with the trolley right outside your door. It's within walking distance of prime Garden district and it's a long walk to the French Quarter...probably 30 minutes to 40 minutes.

We splurged and booked two Bourbon Street balcony rooms for a post-graduation celebration with our two young adult daughters. Although the hotel itself is a little long-in-the-tooth, its location on lower Bourbon Street can't be beat. There are nicer, fancier hotels and inns nearby, but we chose the Royal Sonesta specifically for its location. Yes, it's noisy and you can hear music and rowdy crowds until late at night, but we anticipated this too. Bourbon Street was busier for an early June Monday and Tuesday night than I would have expected, but we had fun sitting on the balcony, throwing beads at the crowds who happened to walk by.", "Great place on Bourbon Street Stayed one night at the Royal Sonesta on Bourbon Street. What a great place, very classy and you can't beat the location. Went in June so the rates were very inexpensive. Rooms were very clean and quiet. Definitely would stay there again.

Parking was also overpriced and the scratched my spouse's custom car when the valet parked it.", "Great hotel!! I have family in New Orleans so I am pretty familiar with the city...I have stayed in a good deal of places/areas of town. The Royal Sonesta, by far, offers the best location and experience. One of the three hotel bars to the GREAT restaurant for breakfast to the fabulous rooms, this place is a treasure. We had a courtyard room that opened up to the pool deck. BEAUTIFUL! And the price was right too!", "Jazzfest Stay here for 8 nights and for the most part it was very enjoyable except for a few monir things that added up. For about 3-4 days the hot water was only luke warm, one day I went out and took off the privacy sign and by 3pm the room was not made up, had to call housekeeping and when I returned at 4pm, it still was not done, had to put in an angry second call to have the room done ASAP. Also one monring I had the privacy sign on and housekeeping still knocked on my door, lucky I was not sleeping.The location cannot be beat and service/staff is still very good.", "Very nice hotel Very nice hotel. The reception area is extremely nice. The rooms are also very nice with large flat screens although they are quite small.Very good breakfast. Very good location though as a result quite noisy.", "Overpriced Stayed there with my family Aug 1 to 4 2005. Good points - its on Bourbon Street. Bad points - its on Bourbon Street + everything else. Asked for a quiet room months ahead, we were given a room next to the elevator: noisy, lots of convention goers yelling up and down the corridor at 3 a.m. Parking is difficult - they have a garage (about $30/ day !!) but its small and spaces are tight. My wife had to go to ER whilst we were there, they didn't even know where the nearest hospital was !

January was a brilliant time to visit, St Mark's square was practically empty and we did not have to queue for anything! Breakfast was basic continental style, but the humourous attention of the waitress more than made up for this.

We had booked a king room and were taken to a cramped room with no view and one double bed. When we complained, the staff said they had no rooms available that fit our confirmed reservation. They offered to give us a comparable room at a related hotel down the street, which turned out to be off the beach and much less nice than this hotel. We returned to reception to tell them the room was unacceptable and were eventually upgraded to a king room at the Outrigger Reef with a partial ocean view. Why they didn't do this first if they didn't have a regular king room I will never know, but it made us very grumpy to wait nearly two hours to get a room after a very long flight.The room was clean, but nothing special. It had a small outdoor patio, but overlooked the pool and many other patios, which made it very loud and not at all private.We would not stay here again.", "Loved the island- The Outrigger Reef was a very nice hotel. I did not however like the enforced valet parking. I was lead to believe we had to valet, but we could have parked on the upper level on our own, and still paid the $13 per day. From what I understand, it could have been worse, some hotels charged as much as $18 per day for parking. There are so many hotels, restaurants and shopping in this small area of Wikiki, that there is no parking space, so you pay dearly for having a car. Every place we went there were also tour busses that would do the same routes, but we did it at our leisure, and stayed at each site as long as we wanted.

The location is very good, being right next to Central Station, but can be a little far from some of the tourist spots such as the Museums, Leidseplein and Jordaan. The hotel itself is very well presented, and staff very polite. However, on one day we left the room at around 10am and returned at 4.30pm to find that the room had not yet been cleaned (even though we had left the 'clean me' tag on the outside of the door). We had to ask at reception 3 times for the room to be cleaned, and over and hour and a half later it eventually was. The towels that we were promised immediately upon complaining turned up over 2 hours later. At no point were we offered anything to appease us, staff simply apologised and were ineffectual, although polite. This was disappointing, as apart from this, the stay was extremely pleasant.", "Awesome hotel next to Central Station? Must eat at sky lounge at top of hotel. It over looks the entire city.

In any event, the rooms were really comfortable, though slightly on the smaller side. We were on the courtyard side of the building, and you'd never know you were steps from the mayhem on Bourbon. The complimentary breakfast was great, and the welcome drinks were a nice touch. Love the courtyard and pool -- very upscale feeling, but cozy and completely non-pretentious. One downside to this being a boutique hotel: there's no housekeeping after midnight, so we had to walk down to get the extra towels the housekeeper never left. Also we had a hard time getting the shower gels refilled, and had to call to ask for this to be done. But otherwise the service was outstanding, especially Shawn at the front desk. I will definitely stay here again and recommend this place to my friends.", "We stayed at the Hotel le Marais for four nights and loved it. This modern, boutique hotel was clean and well-maintained. The beds were heavenly! The one issue in the room was that the shower would spray outside the stall, leaving huge puddles on the floor, so we had to have the shower head practically facing the opposite wall to avoid the mess. The staff was extremely helpful, particularly Pierre, who booked several tours for us and got us $10 discounts per person per tour. The best part of the hotel is that it is in the heart of the French Quarters. This visit was all of our first times in Nola.

The room service advertised is a joke...unless you like greasy Mexican food. The cleaning in the rooms was horrible; barely vacuumed or dusted in almost 2 weeks of staying there and the bathroom was just barely cleaned everyday.

It could as well be closed as it no longer has anything to do with the hotel as such.", "Bed was super comfy, c, water power is strong - something which I miss in some hotels. Room was also equipped with DVD player - it was useful one afternoon when it rained so hard so we spent the time watching films. Other than that, the rest of our stay was wonderful and we'd surely come ."], "source_reviews_b": ["Fantastic hotel - wonderful rooms, great beds, fruit in the room every day, extensive gym....could not have asked for more. A few minutes walk from Orchard Road so when I wanted to do a bit of shopping it was close but far enough away to not hear the noise. The gym and LINE restaurant were WONDERFUL. I will definitely stay here again - perfect for my business trips to Singapore.", "We tacked on 5 days at the Shangri La staying in the Garden Valley wing at the end of our SE Asia Honeymoon and I cannot praise it highly enough, the garden valley wing is an all inclusive break and it's free champagne (Moet) and high class food from 11.00 am till 10.00 pm. The rooms are spacious and luxurious and the staff are very attentive, a reasonable location and a much better option than the faded grandour of Raffles.", "You have to love the far east. The hotels are the best in the world and the Shangri la is up there amoungst the very best, From check in to the room every thing was seamless and calm. This is a word \"calm\" that i would use to describe the Shangri la a lot. The subtle touches like the changing of the carpet in the lift showing the day of the week, to cold water and iced face towels around the pool. Service cannot be faulted and the old world touch of kneeling to serve although a shock to someone from the west was done with such style and grace you grow to enjoy the gesture.", "All the good points have been made in previous reviews but I would like to just emphasise how good the service is here. I stayed in the Valley Wing and, though very expensive, the free afternoon tea, canapes and drinks go some way to mitigating against the high cost. The eggs benedict for breakfast was the best I've had and the Singapore Sling was far better at the Shangri La than the ready mixed mediocrity being served at Raffles. It isn't as centrally located as some hotels but taxis are pretty cheap and it's worth a few minutes in a taxi if it means you can stay at such a wonderful hotel.", "Spent 2 nights at this fabulous hotel during a recent business trip. Excellant service and staff. Rooms are large and standard of cleanlines is very high. Wifi access free throughout the hotel with great connectivity. Hotel is within walking distance of the Orchard Road shopping area, however I believe the hotel also offer a free shuttle service. Hotel has a gym and swimming pool. Buffet breakfast was great, with a huge choice and fresh products. As my departure flight was at 11pm, the hotel allowed freshing up in the health club, with towels etc provided for shower. Would definately return to this hotel for both business and pleasure.", "As a regular business traveller to Singapore I always look forward to staying at the Shangri-La. Great service, attention to detail and the ever present taxi-hailer - make it feel like coming home. Rooms are spacious and comfortable with quiet aircon and welcoming tea and fruit. Room service is of a good standard and reasonably priced. One improvement could be to remember details such as non-smoking preferences - I had to really push for the hotel to move me to a non-smoking room, which they did have available, though at a higher level. Given i was checking in at midnight, for just one night, I really was disappointed that I had to push - who else would have taken the room at that time! That said, generally no complaints and a great hotel with a few extras that you don't always find in Singapore.", "What a wonderful atmosphere and a great room for a great price. The breakfast buffet was out of this world. The room was gorgeous. Service was exceptional.", "The Valley Wing at the Shangri-La is a must! Familiar atmosphere, the absolute friendly and warm staff members knew our name from the first day. In the Lobby all Champagne (Moet Chandon) is free, you will get a glass even when you wait 3 minutes for a taxi... Service is Top-end, nothing to do better. Rooms are beautiful and large, garden and pool-site are very relaxing, so I spent most of the afternoons in the pool with our baby-daughter. If you go to the Shangri-La, book the Valley Wing! Enter the Lobby, sit down, relax and sip your Champagne...

Any flaws that the Grand may have vanish thanks to the staff and many complimentry features. Excellent free breakfast buffet, nice indoor pool and jacuzzi, two rooftop jacuzzis and sitting areas (make sure you use them on warm summer night!) and free gym. Underground parking is expensive, $19.00 per night, but I was not charged. The neighborhood is very colorful, but if you want a sanitized version of a city, stay on the Las Vegas strip.

Watery scrambled eggs, pay extra for a cappuccino, bacon that died two days ago - apart from that though, a great hotel with terrific service. A short walk to the Eaton Centre and Yonge Street. A good diner/grill/bar across the road. Despite the breakfasts, I'd stay there again.", "Liked the hotel, the rooms, the pool, the hot tub on the roof.

The hotel is fantastic and we have never experienced such incredible service before. Our room always looked spectacular, and the front desk staff was always extremely helpful. We ate a couple meals at the hotel which were both great. I would recommend this restaurant and hotel to anyone travelling into Toronto or that even live in Toronto! I've visited Toronto many times and love the city, yet i've never wanted to stay in the hotel so much before. The roof top was beautiful at night or in the day. If you want to mix a little luxury with the odd trip to Toronto then this Hotel is an absolute must.", "We were satisfied with our stay at this hotel. The service was very good, the hotel was clean, the breakfast was decent, and the rooms were just fine. The hotel is in a not great area, but I felt safe, nonetheless. A bit outside of the city center, but the hotel itself is nice and it is close to a subway station, as well as a trolley line. Don't bother renting a vehicle, you won't need it! Also, the hotel offers a shuttle to sites within the downtown district. The swimming pool is very nice, and the roof space is very nice with plenty of seating and the hot tubs were great. The staff were attentive and very gracious. I would definitely stay here again.", "We got a great deal online for a nice room with a beautiful view -- the small suite with a foldout couch was perfect for our family of four. The hotel staff was pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful, with lots of tips for getting around. The location is not excellent -- it's on the outskirts of downtown, and the neighborhood is a bit scary even for those of us from other large cities -- but the hotel provides a free shuttle, and we were able to walk to restaurants and shopping without a problem. The pool room was hot and overchlorinated but adequate to calm down the kids before dinner. All in all, a nice stay, and we'd go back.", "We stayed at the Grand hotel for 2 nights, and it was great. Our Junior Suites were clean, spacious, and very comfortable. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and accomodating. The location was excellent - steps away from the Eaton Centre and great shopping.

The room was a reasonable size as we had one at the end of a corridor and the bed was comfy. The bathrooms however, need some updating, they were tired and not in the best condition.

A bit expensive for the location and the lack of view (my room had a view on a skeleton building (crisis, what crisis?) on the side of the hotel, not charming at all).

They cleaned but the smell didn't go away for all 3 days and they would not change the rooms. The pool is tiny and over crowded with hardly any beds to lie on which is quite difficult with kids in a very hot city. Well done for offering free WiFi but making people check into your Facebook page every time is very irritating.

I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus. Overall I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area or closer to Old Montreal.

We were shocked by the so-called \"standard\" room. It was tiny: to do some ironing on the ironing board, or to have access to the electric power points, one literally had to move the furniture around. Cupboard space was inadequate. The shower was lukewarm. The only redeeming featrure was the location: not in an attractive part of Toronto, but at least within walking distance of the CN Tower and the main railway station. I thought it was exceptionally bad value for money, and would not recommend it.", "The location of this hotel is its best attribute. I was in Toronto for an Argos football game August 12 and stayed at the Strathcona (for the second time). I paid $83USD for a Friday night. This is cheap by downtown T.O. standards. The room was small and clean with no view at all, but I did not care because I was noe in town for the view or the size of the room.

What the hotel lacks in amenities and services they make up for it by being centralized. Near to the night-club scene, sports arenas; Rogers Center/Air Canada Center.

As we were very tired and the weather was terrible, we decided to spend the night at the Regal Airport Hotel before returning home in the city centre the next morning. Thanks to the convenient location of Regal, the heavy downpour did not get us wet as the hotel is connected to the airport by an enclosed link bridge. As a regular hotel guest, we got an upgrade this time. Our suite has a family room and a bed room, large and comfortable enough for my family of three. We had the best sleep in days amd woke up the next morning refreshed.

We are not hassled or stressed with rushing to the airport to catch our flight. The hotel also had regular free shuttle service to Tung Chung (outlet mall) and several stops at downtown HK. This also saved us bus/train fares.

We asked for police assistance but they didn't even bother to call; saying the police could do nothing about it. Nobody asked about what happened or anything; as if nothing had happened.

Waterfront view, 2 balconies, huge living room/dining room/kitchen. 1 1/2 baths-jacuzzi tub and spacious stand up shower. Shuttle service to Duval was nice but would have been nicer to have been within walking distance. Shuttle back to hotel at night was full of rowdy drinkers.

Normally the hotel charges $150 as a penalty but upon learning about our situation the hotel management happily agreed to waive the penalty.

Where we could catch some well needed sleep. Last time we stayed we stayed we were so impressed with the quilty bedding we spent the next day shopping for new sheets for our house, sleeping at parrot key is like sleeping on a cloud, I can't say enough about this place, staff is top- notch,", "From the very first time I stayed there on a short pleasure weekend I feel in love with the resort. I was looking to get away to a tropical place not far from my home in Fort Lauderdale and I found it. Relaxing in the pool, working out or sipping cocktails in one of the three great salt pools took me where I wanted to go to peace and tranquility yet only three hours from home. I have been back now two more times and it's becoming my home away from home. I hghly recommend the resort and all of the staff memebers Sean was the best ask for him when making your reservation. go and enjoy stop reading now. trust me!", "I stayed at Parrot Key once before when it first opened and loved it, so I chose this property again when I needed a room in Key West for Fantasy Fest. The grounds look even more lush and beautiful than before. From the road it's hard to tell what paradise awaits you as you step into the property. My sister and I had a two-level suite that was fantastic. The front desk gave us all the inforamtion we needed on the events and how to get to and from Duval during this busy time. We absolutely loved it and will stay at Parrot Key again next year!", "We stayed two nights in June. The resort was excellent! Staff and service was impeccable. The resort is the right mix of relaxation. We spent most of our days relaxing in the 4 beautiful pools and sitting by the outdoor bar. It is a bit of a drive away from duval street but we weren't too keen on the drunks and parties that you find there so we were quite happy to relax at the resort. We were upgraded to a two bedroom cottage and it was spectacular! I would definitely go back to the parrot key resort again!", "We had the 3 bedroom ocean view cottage. Due to the lush foliage, the ocean is only visible from the decks off the upper rooms. The rooms are spacious and well furnished. The only thing lacking is a washer/dryer and you could live there. The only reason I would not go back is the price - including the resort fee, the lowest rate available in February was just under $600 per night when booked months in advance. We enjoyed our stay, but will try to find something less expensive next time.", "From the moment we checked in we were greeted by very friendly and helpful staff. Oriana, Rutanya, and Shenali (sp) overextended themselves and made us feel more than welcome, like we were at home. We are down for a birthday and the staff was helpful enough to recommend a bakery for a cake and set up the room fit for royalty. The atmosphere is beyond anything we expected. The property is lush and exotic. The rooms are very clean. We will definitely be back =)", "We loved Parrot Key. The rooms and grounds were absolutely beautiful. We especially loved the little porches. Everything was very clean and the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We also enjoyed the onsite jet ski tour!

The situation for a tourist could not be more convenient as it is so central and most sites can be walked to within minutes. When transport is required the Grand Canal is 5 minutes away. As the hotel has no restaurant it is necessary to eat out (no bad thing when visiting a new city) and the recommendations of the concierge can be trusted.

It was quiet and quaint and the hotel staff was very friendly. We first got taken to a room across the bridge from the main hotel (1st floor) that seemed more like a dorm room than a hotel room. We asked to be changed into the main hotel and they showed us two rooms to look at. The first one was the size of a box but the second one was great. The location is great once you get your bearings in Venice. I would stay here again. Don't get room 107 though as it is literally in the breakfast area. We were on the second floor in a corner room.", "When we found this hotel on internet we couldn't even look at others. their website looks great and I was looking forward to discover if the reality raises up to the expectations.

We stayed with two other couples and all agreed that we would recommend this hotel to all our friends back in Australia.

The main advantage as far as I am concerned is its location right on the Grand Canal directly opposite the Santa Lucia railway station and within 100 metres or so of the main (only!) bus station. When you arrive in Venice the vast majority of travellers will arrive at one of these two locations. Then you are set loose into the MAZE that is Venice! When you witness the poor travellers who go round in circles trying to find their hotel, it is comforting to have a hotel that is located in such fine position. As for the accomodation itself, it has all been said previously.", "The hotel is located near the railway station on the relatively peaceful side of the canal.

The location is excellent, on a quiet side street just off the Piazza della Repubblica, close to the metro and a step-on, step-off city tour bus stop. We were able to easily reach the principal city sights from there. Our room was large and very well appointed (and I love that 1940s style elevator to get you there!) The staff was excellent, very helpful. (I had trouble backing up some photos from my camera to a flash drive and they assisted me.) There are a number of very good restaurants nearby so you dont have to fight the tourist hordes around the Spanish Steps or the Fountain of Trevi. Well go back when were in Rome.", "This is a cozy, tucked-away retreat from the busy streets of Rome. Our room was quiet and the owner was attentive and helpful (spoke English well). The breakfast room is a warm and inviting setting with a decent variety of food. The bed was not very comfortable (although I am extremely picky) but every other part of our stay was enjoyable. We stayed at this location three nights and were able to walk comfortably to all major sights without problem. I will not rave about this hotel, but I found nothing materially wrong with it either. This is a typical 2-3 star hotel and makes up for its lack of \"grandness\" by having a fantastically helpful and friendly staff.", "We stayed two nights at this hotel. We found the staff very friendly, and helpful. Our room was clean and of a good size. If you want to experience true italian culture, then this family is for you. The breakfast was continental, and very good and ample. If you want scrambled eggs and bacon when you are in Europe, then stay home. If you want to enjoy the culture you are in then ask this facility for recommendations for restaurants, side trips, etc., they are more than accommodating. We will definately use this hotel on our next visit.", "We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay in Oceania. We had a double room that was spotless and also quite spacious. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and answered any questions we had on places to visit etc. The internet access was very useful and was free. Breakfast was lovely - breads, pastries, juices and coffee. The hotel is in an ideal location, close to all the main sites and on a nice quiet street. Would love to go back!", "I booked a 3 night stay at Hotel Oceania based on a recommendation from Rick Steves. The location is definately convienent as it is a short walk from the train station which is also thier main center for Rome's subway and bus systems. Internet was available in the lobby, but was not available in the room since the wireless was not working correctly. The room was clean and the hotel was nice but our overall experience was just ok.", "We had a wonderful experience at the Hotel Oceania. The location is excellent with public transportation, great restaurants and shopping very nearby. The rooms were quiet and clean. The staff was very gracious and helpful and the serve really delicious coffee! Rick Steves (2012) certainly didn't disappoint.", "We stayed just one night but will surely stay here when again in Rome. Large old room with great renovated bathroom. Very clean and comfortable. Staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful. Even packed us a take away breakfast because we had to leave early.", "We would stay here again. Great location, spacious rooms, good, friendly service. A bonus was classical music drifting up from the opera school on the level below."], "source_reviews_b": ["I feel the hotel is slightly overrated. The setting is fine, and there are lovely orange trees in the nice court yards of the smallish complex. However the rooms are noisy with tilen floors and banging doors. The room window gives unto the open tilen pathway leading past the doors. Breakfast is ok but basic. There is free internet available amidst the breakfast tables. Staff seems a little scarce, with the couple serving breakfast later in the day cleaning the rooms. What is missing however is the loving hand. For instance all flowers are made of plastic, even the azaleas and cyclamen outside in the garden. The personal touch somehow seems missing, and that really is a pity.", "Hotel Santa Maria is a delightful, cheery & quiet place to stay, tucked away in a small street in Trastevere, Antonio (manager) is molto simpatico - friendly and very helpful. The hotel is not a fancy place, but quite comfy enough, with a good breakfast buffet, which you can eat in the lovely courtyard full of orange trees. The colorful neighborhood is great for walking around, lots of shops & outdoor restaurants that stay open late. You can easily walk to other sites in the city, though we mostly took cabs to centro to save time.", "I found this area of Rome to be very special and the Hotel Santa Maria was more than I had expected. I enjoyed the peace and serentity with the safety gates, beautiful breakfast which could be taken either in the eating area or courtyard and a nice wine bar with appetizers. The rooms were clean and well maintained. Personnel were outstanding to work with. The Trastevere area is near all of the major attractions and yet, it is magical to stroll through a maze of fascinating medieval streets with some of the best restaurants in Rome.", "Wonderful place to stay! An intimate, cozy place-loved the orange-tree courtyard. Front desk personnel was most helpful. Cleaning/cooking staff wonderful-very clean rooms. Breakfasts very filling and tasty-the scrambled eggs and cappuccino were my favorites. Neighborhood not touristy. 15-minute walk to the Colosseum; 25 min. to St. Peter's. They arranged driver for airport pickup and dropoff. Bells of neighboring Church could be sleep-disruptive for light sleepers, but earplugs blocked the noise.", "Accomodating people who are always pleasent. Good breakfast. A block from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto but tucked away from all bustle. We walked to the center of Rome, Campo Fiore, Janiculum, all over Trastevere. Close to #8 tram with connections to airport, Tivoli and all of Rome. Private courtyard through gated drive. A good refuge for tired feet and bodies. We would go back.", "We stayed here for five nights. a great base for exploring Rome; thank heavens we took a taxi - we'd never have found it by ourselves! Right in the middle of Trastevere, ideal for restaurants etc. Nice room, pity next doors plumbing is so noisy though, otherwise very peaceful. Very nice staff - would stay here again.", "Spent 4 restful nights at a lovely oasis of calm in Trastevere. Very well looked after, nothing was too much trouble. Very convenient for all parts of Rome and Vatican. Lovely that rooms opened out into open air of courtyards.", "This was a charming, albeit somewhat pricey, refuge from the overload of Rome. The employees were wonderful and the setting very peaceful. The location was also very handy, and I would definitely stay here again."], "gen_a": "The Oceania hotel was recommended to us by Rick Steves and we couldn't have been more pleased with our stay.
