The hotel is at a very central location, within 10 minutes walk to Colosseum. But the room is very small. The shower place is tiny. I am a tiny person.

The breakfast is reasonable, but not exciting.", "We stayed at the Apollo in the end of July. What can I say?! Excellent hotel, friendly and helpful stuff, really good breakfast especially cakes and cappucino in a big cup. 7 minutes walk to Colloseum and 15 to Trevi Fountain.

We did not stayed at the hotel itself but in an apartment some corners away. It was big, clean and had all that we were looking for.

For a 3 star hotel it was a pleasant experience and we will repeat again when next in Rome", "Stayed here for five nights back in October last year. Hotel is in a great location allowing you to walk to all the main attractions and explore, rather than having to rely on public transport.

You need the opposite after a long trip. The room was also slightly disappointing. We found it to be small and the design a bit half hearted with a very strange shower!

The Gladstone had really friendly and engaging staff. Rooms were unique and fun...no cookie cutter boxes with the same old crap. Even the elevator (circa 1900) was crazy and fun. Great food, music and decor and location are killer. Lots to do around the hotel. Try it out if you want something different!", "I was very much looking forward to staying here, but I was quite disappointed. I was in town on business for a week, and my wife and child stayed with me the first day. The Gladstone is clearly more interested in being an arts/cafe/performance/bar venue for hipsters than a hotel. Details don't get addressed, the rooms are crazy small, and it's just not comfortable for any extended stay. I will try The Drake next time.", "Fantastic hotel, great drinks, food and the staff super nice and cool.... only complaints were that our left over margarita glasses weren't cleaned up, mattress wasn't great as it sagged in the middle and the shower felt like we were washing in a horizontal MRI machine!

However, I really will not stay here for a leisure trip. As mentioned in another review, there are just no personal touches or charm. The staff is polite but the service is more mechanical, rather than from the heart. There is a pool, but it offers a view of skyscrapers nearby. It's really quite hard to relax in this evironment.The location is not bad as it is connected to the subway via a big shopping mall. However, in the morning, a cab ride can take quite long to reach the central business district due to traffic jam.", "OK, not spectacular. I spent a few nights at the Shangri La in August.

We paid for a cab from Central St on arrival but felt rather ripped of as it was a20 and was only a 5 minute ride. On the way back we caught a tram which was much cheaper (actually it was free as we did not realise you had to pay the driver when you got on!) and just as quick. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will hopefully be going back in the near future!", "the room was very small, but that's not the biggest problem - the receptionists were. the wifi at the lobby was very slow and the receptionists didnt even know how guests can log on (user name, password and patience required). but the worst was a french-speaking tall male receptionist who was extremely rude and made it very clear that he didnt like being asked about how to connect to the internet. he made condescending remarks in french about american tourists (and i'm not even american!). the carpet is filthy and so is the hotel's surroundings - noisy, crowded, and the street is disgusting after rain.", "I booked this hotel after reading reviews on this site and Expedia, with a real priority for me being its cleanliness and quietness. It didn't disappoint on either count and had the added bonus of being in an excellent location - far enough away from the slightly too brash touristy bits but near enough as not to be a long walk from anywhere useful. The modern room was nice and the bathroom was excellent, although some might be surprised at the European practice of having no shower curtain so the bathroom floor gets a bit wet. I'd definitely book here again.", "The Hotel is perfectly placed for both travel and entertainment on the edge of Rembrandt Square. It is within very easy walking distance to everywhere in Central Amsterdam, but sufficiently on the edge for it to be quiet at night. It has a first class seafood Bistro if you wish to eat in. It's main clientele are business and corporate, which should tell you a lot about the overall quality and respect this hotel has. This has been my hotel of choice, even when travelling privately to Amsterdam with family.", "A good hotel bang in the centre of Amsterdam. Rooms are clean and modern and I will be staying there again. A couple of things to note: My room had mosquitos (common for AMS this summer), they were fully booked so could not give me another room but did eventually find some fly spay so problem solved. Breakfast is expensive at EUR15, just take a walk down the street and have a better breakfast in one of the cafes.", "We found our room the be of nice size and bothe the room and bath were easy to navigate in a wheelchair. The beds were compfortable and the room were nicely appointed. The staff was most helpful with directions and other touristy information. The food in the restaurant's food was quite good with a nice selection. We would recommend the Eden Rembrandt Square as our stay was quite good.", "The location of the hotel is excellent. Its 5 mins from the Waterlooplein metro station and hence easily accessible. Room service was mediocre - the staff came to clean the room once in 3 days in spite of a reminder.

Our room was first class. The hotel was excellent value, the breakfast buffet was unlimited and varied and the service could not be bettered. The situation for a tourist could not be more convenient as it is so central and most sites can be walked to within minutes. When transport is required the Grand Canal is 5 minutes away. As the hotel has no restaurant it is necessary to eat out (no bad thing when visiting a new city) and the recommendations of the concierge can be trusted. We followed their advice and were very happy indeed. It helps to allow them to book the restaurants, as they managed to get us in at our preferred time, when we could not. Tony Brazier", "we had a wonderful 5 days in venice, and the hotel is really nice and well located. when we arrived they tried to put us in an attic room, which was really small and full of low beams and dark too. we eventually got a lovely room and had to pay an extra 20 euro a day for the pleasure. the breakfast is great. the trip to murano is not good, they offer free transport to the factory, and when you get there they really push you to buy very expensive glass. i would advise anybody going to murano to go on the normal boat and then you have choice, because there are several factories and thousands of shops and all much cheaper than the one we were sent to.", "We stayed at this hotel in a busy September time. It was quiet and quaint and the hotel staff was very friendly. We first got taken to a room across the bridge from the main hotel (1st floor) that seemed more like a dorm room than a hotel room. We asked to be changed into the main hotel and they showed us two rooms to look at. The first one was the size of a box but the second one was great. The location is great once you get your bearings in Venice. I would stay here again. Don't get room 107 though as it is literally in the breakfast area. We were on the second floor in a corner room.", "When we found this hotel on internet we couldn't even look at others. their website looks great and I was looking forward to discover if the reality raises up to the expectations.
