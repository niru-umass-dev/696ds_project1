While I had a postcard view of the Bosphorous from my room, I could further embrace that beauty and enjoy drinks, snacks, reading material and conversation with fellow guests. The Conrad, Istanbul was a breath of fresh air when it comes to the hospitality industry. My requests were handled to my satisfactions, quickly and it was flattering to know that President Obama had also stayed at the hotel in April 2009. The one and only criticism I have of the hotel and its services is the exorbitant in-room internet fees. Hopefully those either have been or will be readjusted to a more industry competitive rate.", "I stayed here on a business trip. The hotel has a very good location, very close to the shores of the Bosphorus, 5 minutes from Yildiz Park.

Would recommend the hotel.", "Stayed here on business for three nights. Reception very efficient and welcoming. Rooms are a nice size with all facilities you would expect and housekeeping was perfect. The bar on the 14th floor has great views of the Bosporus - you must go up there.

I would be happy to visit again.", "The hotel has beautiful public spaces, and the meals were delicious. You can walk across the park to many small restaurants favored by young people and university students. The rooms are modern with bathtubs.

Tony Brazier", "we had a wonderful 5 days in venice, and the hotel is really nice and well located. when we arrived they tried to put us in an attic room, which was really small and full of low beams and dark too. we eventually got a lovely room and had to pay an extra 20 euro a day for the pleasure. the breakfast is great. the trip to murano is not good, they offer free transport to the factory, and when you get there they really push you to buy very expensive glass. i would advise anybody going to murano to go on the normal boat and then you have choice, because there are several factories and thousands of shops and all much cheaper than the one we were sent to.", "We stayed at this hotel in a busy September time. It was quiet and quaint and the hotel staff was very friendly. We first got taken to a room across the bridge from the main hotel (1st floor) that seemed more like a dorm room than a hotel room. We asked to be changed into the main hotel and they showed us two rooms to look at. The first one was the size of a box but the second one was great. The location is great once you get your bearings in Venice. I would stay here again. Don't get room 107 though as it is literally in the breakfast area. We were on the second floor in a corner room.", "When we found this hotel on internet we couldn't even look at others. their website looks great and I was looking forward to discover if the reality raises up to the expectations.

All the staff could not have been more helpful with directions, sight seeing recommendations and restaurants. We had a blue room as we felt we needed a little bit of room and preferred a view of the Grand Canal We were certainly not disappointed. After a busy day shopping and sighteeing we would arrive back to our beautiful room with a bottle of vino, open our windows to the Grand Canal and watch Venetian life pass by, it was brilliant! The twin basin bathroom with beautiful chandeliers was a little luxury also when there is two of you. After choosing this hotel from many on tripadvisor we were so relieved to find it was everything we had hoped, read and wished for. Thank you Alessandro and Gianni for a memorable stay! I hope to one day return with my husband!", "The Huddos. Paynesville. Victoria. Australia We have returned to Australia after 6 weeks travelling overseas, we stayed at some wonderful places but our favorite place was Hotel Antiche Figure in Venice. Our stay was made so memorable by the receptionist who made us so welcome and looked after all our needs, the position right on the Grand Canal and the service. We stayed with two other couples and all agreed that we would recommend this hotel to all our friends back in Australia. The breakfast was fine and the rooms were very clean, one of our group had upgraded to a balcony room looking over the canal and l would recommend that it is well worth paying the extra for the view of all the activity that happens on the Grand Canal.", "The Hotel Antiche lives up to all of the positive reviews that have been written abuot it. The main advantage as far as I am concerned is its location right on the Grand Canal directly opposite the Santa Lucia railway station and within 100 metres or so of the main (only!) bus station. When you arrive in Venice the vast majority of travellers will arrive at one of these two locations. Then you are set loose into the MAZE that is Venice! When you witness the poor travellers who go round in circles trying to find their hotel, it is comforting to have a hotel that is located in such fine position. As for the accomodation itself, it has all been said previously.", "The hotel is located near the railway station on the relatively peaceful side of the canal. We loved the location because we could wander the back streets and avoid the hordes of day trippers and other tourists. We also used the vaporettos to explore Lido/Murano etc If you are mainly interested in St Mark's etc the hotel may feel a little remote. The corner canal view room we had was light, airy and exceptionally well maintained. Breakfast was great. The staff were first class. Another small elevator, however it seemed very well maintained - I took the stairs anyway !", "Upon checking in we were offered a choice of rooms and chose to stay in a corner bedroom on the top floor overlooking the Grand Canal which was awesome. The room was spacious clean and tidy with coffee/tea making facilities. The staff were extremely helpful and upon arrival gave us a map with ideas of places to visits and the best routes to take to the various sites. An excellent buffet breakfast was included. The hotel is situated opposite the Railway station with just one bridge to walk across with our luggage which was ideal. Would highly recommend this hotel", "We stayed in this delightful hotel for 4 nights, as an 18th birthday treat for my daughter. We had two lovely canal view rooms and the view was fascinating. The location was amazing. It was an easy walk to all of the main tourist attractions and when the feet were tired, it was central for the main water boat routes. It was extremely pleasant to sit outside in the evenings to enjoy a drink and to watch the gondoliers. I would have no hesitation at all in recommending this gem of a hotel.", "Fine hotel.very close to the train station which is great. Pretty far from the main tourist sights (i.e. San Marco Piazza).

For the first stay, the room was directly opposite the lift with a sea view, it is fairly small and comfortable; for the second stay, the room was at the corner directly above the entrance side, this room is much bigger, in much better condition, and we are treated with Turkish Delights on a silver plate,placed on the bed, very very nice. The hotel slippers are very comfortable, they will last and they are not made of paper like the cheaper ones.

No wireless internet in the rooms, only available in the lobby.", "The Oceania is a 2 - 3 star hotel but where it lacks in its grandeur it makes up for it with its staff. There is also the enjoyable music in the air from the nearby opera school and the hotel is not only comfortable but clean. The hotel's location is excellent. It lies just off of the Piazza della Repubblica on a quiet street and is close to buses and trains to allow reaching the city and sights easily. The hotel had a spotlessly clean, old double room with a great renovated bathroom. Breakfast was an ample continental breakfast with bread, pastries, juices, and coffee. it was lovely and you can get it to take away if you need to leave early. The Internet was only available in the lobby.", "The Hotel Oceania has classical music from the opera school below drifting up, which is very beautiful and atmospheric. The hotel is in an excellent location. It is situated on a quite side street close to Piazza della Repubblica, the metro and the principal sights of the city. The hotel's rooms are clean, spacious and with a renovated bathroom. A continental breakfast including breads, pastries, juices and coffee. There is the option to take away if needed. The hotel provided internet in the lobby,"], "entity_b_summary": ["The hotel seems to be missing the personal details and it is perhaps slightly overrated. This hotel is beautifully set for walking to great sites of the city as well as shops and outdoor restaurants located close-by. The small complex that the hotel is located within had some beautiful orange trees as well, adding to the colourful neighbourhood. The rooms here are really lovely although were a bit noisy with doors banging. The breakfast buffet was really tasty if a little bit basic. The scrambled eggs are highly recommended. There was some noise coming from the bells of the nearby church therefore it is recommended to bring earplugs.", "This hotel provides a wonderful, cosy and convenient place to stay. It is a little pricey however it's really charming. The hotel is ideally situated for local restaurants, being only a stone's throw from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto too. The hotel is close to a tram link to the airport, Tivoli and other areas in Rome. It was great that the rooms opened onto the courtyards but this and the tiled floors made them rather noisy. The hotel's breakfast was adequate but was nice to enjoy in a courtyard of orange trees. It is worth mentioning that the bell chimes from a nearby church can clearly be heard in the rooms, which may be a negative for some guests.", "This hotel is a very nice and convenient base to explore Rome and the Vatican from but lacks a personal touch. It is cozy and charming but maybe overrated a little. This hotel is ideal for restaurants and in the middle of Trastevere and is only a block away from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto and within walking distance of the center of Rome, Campo Fiore and Janiculum. It is also not far from the tram with connections to the airport and there are lots of shops and beautiful colorful neighborhoods all around. The rooms are lovely in that there is the option for them to be opened out into the open air with the courtyards. However, the rooms can be become rather noisy due to the tilen floors and the doors that bang. There were not many staff here. Generally a very good buffet breakfast that offers scrambled eggs and cappuccino amongst other things. There is also access to the lovely courtyard that is covered in orange trees for when you want to eat your breakfast. The bells from the nearby church could cause sleep issues."], "common_summary": ["The rooms of the hotel are clean and the staff are helpful.", "This hotel features nice clean rooms and very helpful staff.", "This hotel has very helpful staff and the rooms are very clean."], "entity_a_uid": ["UR114093264", "UR37650228", "UR8703059", "UR3925793", "UR11027429", "UR128066405", "UR29857063", "UR122756295"], "entity_b_uid": ["UR55381933", "UR112721290", "UR7839302", "UR95184087", "UR54908740", "UR3294271", "UR4477840", "UR3015805"], "entity_a_reviews": ["We spent two nights here in May, 2011 and really enjoyed it. The location is excellent, on a quiet side street just off the Piazza della Repubblica, close to the metro and a step-on, step-off city tour bus stop. We were able to easily reach the principal city sights from there. Our room was large and very well appointed (and I love that 1940s style elevator to get you there!) The staff was excellent, very helpful. (I had trouble backing up some photos from my camera to a flash drive and they assisted me.) There are a number of very good restaurants nearby so you dont have to fight the tourist hordes around the Spanish Steps or the Fountain of Trevi. Well go back when were in Rome.", "This is a cozy, tucked-away retreat from the busy streets of Rome. Our room was quiet and the owner was attentive and helpful (spoke English well). The breakfast room is a warm and inviting setting with a decent variety of food. The bed was not very comfortable (although I am extremely picky) but every other part of our stay was enjoyable. We stayed at this location three nights and were able to walk comfortably to all major sights without problem. I will not rave about this hotel, but I found nothing materially wrong with it either. This is a typical 2-3 star hotel and makes up for its lack of \"grandness\" by having a fantastically helpful and friendly staff.", "We stayed two nights at this hotel. We found the staff very friendly, and helpful. Our room was clean and of a good size. If you want to experience true italian culture, then this family is for you. The breakfast was continental, and very good and ample. If you want scrambled eggs and bacon when you are in Europe, then stay home. If you want to enjoy the culture you are in then ask this facility for recommendations for restaurants, side trips, etc., they are more than accommodating. We will definately use this hotel on our next visit.", "We couldn't have been more pleased with our stay in Oceania. We had a double room that was spotless and also quite spacious. The staff were all very friendly and helpful and answered any questions we had on places to visit etc. The internet access was very useful and was free. Breakfast was lovely - breads, pastries, juices and coffee. The hotel is in an ideal location, close to all the main sites and on a nice quiet street. Would love to go back!", "I booked a 3 night stay at Hotel Oceania based on a recommendation from Rick Steves. The location is definately convienent as it is a short walk from the train station which is also thier main center for Rome's subway and bus systems. Internet was available in the lobby, but was not available in the room since the wireless was not working correctly. The room was clean and the hotel was nice but our overall experience was just ok.", "We had a wonderful experience at the Hotel Oceania. The location is excellent with public transportation, great restaurants and shopping very nearby. The rooms were quiet and clean. The staff was very gracious and helpful and the serve really delicious coffee! Rick Steves (2012) certainly didn't disappoint.", "We stayed just one night but will surely stay here when again in Rome. Large old room with great renovated bathroom. Very clean and comfortable. Staff couldn't be nicer or more helpful. Even packed us a take away breakfast because we had to leave early.", "We would stay here again. Great location, spacious rooms, good, friendly service. A bonus was classical music drifting up from the opera school on the level below."], "entity_b_reviews": ["I feel the hotel is slightly overrated. The setting is fine, and there are lovely orange trees in the nice court yards of the smallish complex. However the rooms are noisy with tilen floors and banging doors. The room window gives unto the open tilen pathway leading past the doors. Breakfast is ok but basic. There is free internet available amidst the breakfast tables. Staff seems a little scarce, with the couple serving breakfast later in the day cleaning the rooms. What is missing however is the loving hand. For instance all flowers are made of plastic, even the azaleas and cyclamen outside in the garden. The personal touch somehow seems missing, and that really is a pity.", "Hotel Santa Maria is a delightful, cheery & quiet place to stay, tucked away in a small street in Trastevere, Antonio (manager) is molto simpatico - friendly and very helpful. The hotel is not a fancy place, but quite comfy enough, with a good breakfast buffet, which you can eat in the lovely courtyard full of orange trees. The colorful neighborhood is great for walking around, lots of shops & outdoor restaurants that stay open late. You can easily walk to other sites in the city, though we mostly took cabs to centro to save time.", "I found this area of Rome to be very special and the Hotel Santa Maria was more than I had expected. I enjoyed the peace and serentity with the safety gates, beautiful breakfast which could be taken either in the eating area or courtyard and a nice wine bar with appetizers. The rooms were clean and well maintained. Personnel were outstanding to work with. The Trastevere area is near all of the major attractions and yet, it is magical to stroll through a maze of fascinating medieval streets with some of the best restaurants in Rome.", "Wonderful place to stay! An intimate, cozy place-loved the orange-tree courtyard. Front desk personnel was most helpful. Cleaning/cooking staff wonderful-very clean rooms. Breakfasts very filling and tasty-the scrambled eggs and cappuccino were my favorites. Neighborhood not touristy. 15-minute walk to the Colosseum; 25 min. to St. Peter's. They arranged driver for airport pickup and dropoff. Bells of neighboring Church could be sleep-disruptive for light sleepers, but earplugs blocked the noise.", "Accomodating people who are always pleasent. Good breakfast. A block from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto but tucked away from all bustle. We walked to the center of Rome, Campo Fiore, Janiculum, all over Trastevere. Close to #8 tram with connections to airport, Tivoli and all of Rome. Private courtyard through gated drive. A good refuge for tired feet and bodies. We would go back.", "We stayed here for five nights. a great base for exploring Rome; thank heavens we took a taxi - we'd never have found it by ourselves! Right in the middle of Trastevere, ideal for restaurants etc. Nice room, pity next doors plumbing is so noisy though, otherwise very peaceful. Very nice staff - would stay here again.", "Spent 4 restful nights at a lovely oasis of calm in Trastevere. Very well looked after, nothing was too much trouble. Very convenient for all parts of Rome and Vatican. Lovely that rooms opened out into open air of courtyards.", "This was a charming, albeit somewhat pricey, refuge from the overload of Rome. The employees were wonderful and the setting very peaceful. The location was also very handy, and I would definitely stay here again."]}]
