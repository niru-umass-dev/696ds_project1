I do enjoy the Miller Harris citron toiletries, so that is a plus. Overall I'd rather be more centrally located to the main downtown area or closer to Old Montreal.

The hotel isn't really central. The area is quite safe so really the location is pretty good. The rooms in the hotel are modern. Some of the hotel's staff seemed disinterested in helping with an incident at the hotel. It is worth mentioning that you can get a complimentary coffee from the barista. There is a coffee machine supplied here, which is fine. The parking at the hotel costs 12 a night.", "The hotel is an ideal place for a short trip. The hotel is not in the centre of Rome. The rooms are mostly very clean and are quite decent with a modern feel to them. A downside was upon opening the window to find a lot of black mould. Some of the staff members didn't respond well to an issue that occurred. They showed no apathy or even any interest after the incident and that really let the staff down. The coffee here at the hotel is good and you can get free cappuccinos from the barista as well. The parking at the hotel can be expensive, costing around 12 per night.", "An excellent hotel that comes highly recommended for short stays in Rome. This hotel is not based in the city centre. Well maintained rooms, that are cleaned to a reasonable standard. However, there is an issue with black mould around the windows, and there is no air conditioning available. Generally speaking the staff at this hotel are disinterested and apathetic. The breakfast at the hotel is good and offers a variety of options and you can get a free cappuccino from the barista. Car or van rental is an option but comes with a parking fee of 12 a night. Also, there is a Nescafe coffee machine which is ok but a barista is located nearby."], "entity_b_summary": ["The hotel made guests feel safe and comfortable. Everything is accessible from this hotel, which is really useful for exploring the city. There are lots of attractions you can reach by foot. The hotel has adequate rooms with air conditioning and the internet was available. The staff of this hotel allowed a call to the USA using the hotel phones. The complimentary breakfast buffet provided by the hotel was generally good, but the restaurant left a bit to be desired. The temperature at this hotel did not help when trying to sleep and unfortunately the charge for a brief call is really expensive.", "This is a really comfortable and secure hotel that will provide happiness. The hotel is in a good central location and a short walk to Termini train station. There are several restaurants close to the hotel. The rooms are of a decent size at this hotel and they also feature wired access to the internet. The baths are pretty large in the bathroom. There is a breakfast buffet supplied for free here and it's really good. The restaurant at this hotel could be better though. The temperature within the hotel was not comfortable and the charge for a timed call of two to three minutes could be as much as $40USD.", "Guests are made to feel very secure and comfortable at this hotel. The hotel's relatively quiet location is centralized in Rome and close to several other hotels, good restaurants. So much is within easy walking distance and a lot of Rome is very accessible this way. Very spacious rooms for guests to enjoy, with air conditioning for guests to make good use off. This hotel has a fantastic breakfast on offer and it is complimentary though the restaurant could be better. The phone charges for a brief call was over $40."], "common_summary": ["Some of the staff at the hotel were helpful.

Wish have stayed longer. Nice and superclean clean modern hotel, superb breakfast with plenty of variety and fresh capuccino made in front of you, and very helpful and polite staff both in reception and breakfast room that makes your stay even more enjoyable. Even thought not in centre of Rome, close enough by public transportation very easy and accesible: bus line 85 runs often one block from hotel, takes you to Colesseum and near Trevi? Metro linea B, about 5 blocks from hotel takes you to centre or Ananigna to take bus to Ciampino, and train to Fiumicino airport 2-3 blocks from hotel: only 5 euros takes you in a bit without stops. Only problem with Metro line B is that stopped working after 9:00PM. Hope it changes soon, but still OK. Would definitely reccomend hotel to anybody and cannot wait to go back now in June for 2 nights.", "We (a family of 9 including a toddler & an adolescent) went there last October. Having stayed at a new Holiday Inn Express in Milan last year, we were hoping to repeat the same 3-star experience. The receptionists were accomodating/business-like. We rented a van & had to pay 12 parking/night. However, everybody was disappointed with the small room (triple BR), old stained pillows & sheets, cleanliness & service. The only time that we opened our window was on the last day of our stay (it rained) & was shocked to find out that the window sill was full of black molds. My son had his first asthma attack when we went home. I've just read another review from a previous guest abt. 2 months ago stating the same problem with the molds/mildew. Obviously, the hotel didn't do anything about it.", "We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express Rome - San Giovanni for 3 nights during our 8 day trip in Italy. On our last morning, we were told to leave our baggage at the lobby while breakfast and we did. When we returned, we sadly found out that one of our baggage, the one containing most of our gifts, was missing. Since we wouldn't be able to go back and get new ones, it was really devastating for us. The staff members were not even slighly interested in the situation. We asked for police assistance but they didn't even bother to call; saying the police could do nothing about it. Nobody asked about what happened or anything; as if nothing had happened. The apathy, the staff members showed, made us regretfully think that some of them may have something to do with the robbery.", "We stayed at Holiday Inn Express Rome San Giovanni simply going by what others had to say about the place in Tripadvisor. I am glad I did that. I got a good price on the hiexpress website by booking in advance. Though the hotel is not right in the heart of the city, it is a very convenient to get there by bus. We also used the sub way station but that was a longer walk. The rooms are very clean and modern. The front desk staff are helpful . Breakfast was good with a lot of choice. Would definitely stay there again.", "I stayed at the hotel from January 26 to January 31 and the service over all is really great, but there is nothing or none that matches service, attention, dedication and compromise with the client than SIMONE DI PORTO and ALESSANDRA COPPOCA, both of them really are committed and love what they do, always aware of what you need and willing to help you. ANd these review is coming from a long term priority club member with Platinum Status, besides the deco of the hotel and overall was good. Hope to go back to the same hotel", "We Were only in rome for 2 days and 2 nights and found Express a good place for a short stay. At first we thought the area looked a bit Dodgey But compared to Rome centre it is not too bad. There is a nice Restaurant (Sacco) just around the corner which, although a little pricey, is very pleasant. It is very close to the Station, Just a 10 minute walk and another 10 to Termini Station. Also There is free parking just outside reception", "This is a good hotel, it is very decent , nice rooms(though I'm not sure if it has air conditioning), it is very close to the Metro, which was our main transportation throughout our trip. it also has a bus station a minute away that is also very usefull. Money well spent!", "Very clean rooms, super friendly and helpful staff. We checked in early in the morning and were accommodated without charge. The breakfast was perfect. Make sure you get a few free cappuccino's from the Barista. The Nescafe machine is fine but the cappuccino's from the barrista (Coffee Bar) are better."], "entity_b_reviews": ["You will be comfortable at this hotel. The rooms and baths are large; cleaning service is excellent. It is relatively quiet in busy, central Rome, therefore a very good location to stay for sightseeing. The main Metro terminal is a short walk away. Breakfast is entirely adequate and complimentary. There is a free Internet connection in the lobby and rooms are wired for the Internet. One caution: should you need to telephone the USA, the hotel phones offer a \"1508\" access code. While the connection is fast and clear, the charge for a timed brief call of two or theee minutes is over $40 usd. Use your ATT card for international calls and save.", "having just returned from a weeks stay at the universo hotel,i found it to be good value for money,on our arrival we did not have the room we booked and were disappointed,when we brought this to the hotels attention our room was changed the next day which we were more than happy with,breakfast was also very good with lots to choose from,don't understand the negative comments regarding breakfast on some reviews.i would definately return to this hotel.", "Hotel's location is amazing since its 2 mins walk from the main train station that will take u to airport in 25 mins. 10 mins away from downtown (walking) and around 15-20 from Coloseum ! Central location, with lots of hotels around Friendly staff, and really AMAZING breakfast. The restaurant is not the best you can get. Really nice rooms :)", "We stayed 4 nights, and felt secure and comfortable. This is a fairly impersonal hotel, where the staff did not speak unless spoken to, although they were helpful when requests were made. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Our room was a loft, with the king bed up the stairs from the sitting area and bathroom. Several good restaurants nearby.", "Good location if you plan to stay close to Termini rail station is a few minutes walk. Hotel itself not really impressive the rooms are very small with no drawers and a tiny bathroom with a shower only. Does have air conditioning which is about the only good part .Buffet Breakfast was good but overall I wouldnt stay again at this hotel", "We stayed here twice in May and would happily stay again. The rooms were spacious, the breakfast was yum, and the staff were friendly and helpful. You could walk to a lot of Rome's attractions from here but we chose to use the hop on hop off bus which had a stop just around the corner.", "Don't expect t set yur thermostat below 80 degrees. No matter what setting you use, the front desk controls the room temperature and will not set it below 26 Celsius, or 78 Fahrenheit. Disgusting sleeping temperature, and of course does not make for a good vacation. Never again.", "We had a great stay. Close to the train station and many attractions. We walked all over Rome from here. Great breakfast, clean rooms, but the staff was makes it extra special."]}]
