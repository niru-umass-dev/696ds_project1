The staff at the hotel were really nice and didn't even say a simplesorry afterwards. Breakfast was adequate and there were hot options. The hotel had an issue with one of the lifts being shut off, but it didn't bother us at all.", "reference": ["The stay at this hotel was really great and enjoyable.

Clean and tidy room with a comfy bed. Some of the staff at the hotel were helpful, but some had an unprofessional attitude. The hotel served simple French cuisine with a view of the canal, but the breakfast's hot items would go quickly. The hotel has secure parking available below the complex. It is worth nothing that one of the lifts may be out of order, so it takes a little longer to get the other lift.", "This hotel seems like it is brand new which is a plus. It is in a picturesque setting and is simplistically clean. The hotel is situated in a good location just outside Paris with two cafe bars nearby.

There are also lifts provided, which can be a bit of a wait but there are also stairs to use.", "This hotel is a great option for those visiting Paris with a specific price range in mind, as it is a gem in what can be pretty bad accommodation in regards to this standard. The setting is lovely and really suited to its surroundings, making it a simple yet effective choice. Ideal location just on the outskirts of the main city, with multiple cafe bars close by for guests to enjoy if they fancy leaving the hotel. However, it is not in walking distance from the main station which can be off putting for some. The views from the rooms overlook the canals with its boats and looking onwards to the rotunda near the metro station in Stalingrad. There is also a good-sized bathroom with a great shower, though no bath and the room itself was clean and very large. The bed is comfortable and the rooms included all the expected facilities, an internet connection, and coffee or tea. The service was okay, as the staff generally try to be helpful where they can. But it could be better at times. The French food served nearby the hotel was simple but proper, it was a great place to eat.
