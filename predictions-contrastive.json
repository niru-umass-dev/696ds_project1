This hotel is beautifully set for walking to great sites of the city as well as shops and outdoor restaurants located close-by. The small complex that the hotel is located within had some beautiful orange trees as well, adding to the colourful neighbourhood. The rooms here are really lovely although were a bit noisy with doors banging. The breakfast buffet was really tasty if a little bit basic. The scrambled eggs are highly recommended. There was some noise coming from the bells of the nearby church therefore it is recommended to bring earplugs.",
        "This hotel provides a wonderful, cosy and convenient place to stay. It is a little pricey however it's really charming. The hotel is ideally situated for local restaurants, being only a stone's throw from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto too. The hotel is close to a tram link to the airport, Tivoli and other areas in Rome. It was great that the rooms opened onto the courtyards but this and the tiled floors made them rather noisy. The hotel's breakfast was adequate but was nice to enjoy in a courtyard of orange trees. It is worth mentioning that the bell chimes from a nearby church can clearly be heard in the rooms, which may be a negative for some guests.",
        "This hotel is a very nice and convenient base to explore Rome and the Vatican from but lacks a personal touch. It is cozy and charming but maybe overrated a little. This hotel is ideal for restaurants and in the middle of Trastevere and is only a block away from Santa Maria Maggiore and Ponte Sisto and within walking distance of the center of Rome, Campo Fiore and Janiculum. It is also not far from the tram with connections to the airport and there are lots of shops and beautiful colorful neighborhoods all around. The rooms are lovely in that there is the option for them to be opened out into the open air with the courtyards. However, the rooms can be become rather noisy due to the tilen floors and the doors that bang. There were not many staff here. Generally a very good buffet breakfast that offers scrambled eggs and cappuccino amongst other things. There is also access to the lovely courtyard that is covered in orange trees for when you want to eat your breakfast. The bells from the nearby church could cause sleep issues."
